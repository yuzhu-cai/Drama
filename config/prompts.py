I will give you two answers of a same math problem. The first one is the groundtruth and the second one is a student's answer.
Groundtruth Answer:
{groundtruth_answer}
Student's Answer:
{generated_answer}
Your duty is to give judgements on whether the student's answer is correct. Note that:
1) If the student's answer is correct, reply ANSWER_CORRECT. If the student's answer is wrong, reply ANSWER_WRONG.
2) If the final answer format of groundtruth answer and generated answer is different(for example, decimal and fractional), you should validate whether they are equal. If they are equal, you should also reply ANSWER_CORRECT.
3) You must include ANSWER_CORRECT or ANSWER_WRONG in your reply.

work_template = """You are an organizer responsible for analyzing and breaking down tasks into subtasks for either a math agent or a code agent. Follow these steps:

1. Analyze the query and determine whether it is primarily a math task (e.g., calculations, equations, proofs, statistics) or a code task (e.g., programming, debugging, algorithm implementation).

2. Divide the task into smaller, actionable subtasks that can be assigned to the appropriate agent.

3. Output the result in the following dictionary format:

```json
{{
    "type": "math" | "code",
    "tasks": ["description of subtask 1", "description of subtask 2", ...]
}}
```

Example Query:
"Solve the equation 2x + 5 = 15 and write a Python script to plot the solution."

Example Output:
```json
{{
    "type": "math",
    "tasks": [
        "Solve the equation 2x + 5 = 15 for x.",
        "Verify the solution by substituting x back into the equation."

Now, analyze the following query and provide the output in the required format:
