To solve the original query, we need to find the sum of all integers \( n \) such that \( \frac{12}{n} \) is also an integer. This condition implies that \( n \) must be a divisor of 12.

### Step 1: Identify the Divisors of 12
The divisors of 12 can be found by determining all integers that can divide 12 without leaving a remainder. The prime factorization of 12 is:

\[
12 = 2^2 \times 3^1
\]

From this factorization, we can list the positive divisors of 12:
- \( 1 \)
- \( 2 \)
- \( 3 \)
- \( 4 \)
- \( 6 \)
- \( 12 \)

Including the negative divisors, we have:
- \( -1 \)
- \( -2 \)
- \( -3 \)
- \( -4 \)
- \( -6 \)
- \( -12 \)

Thus, the complete list of integers \( n \) such that \( \frac{12}{n} \) is an integer is:

\[
1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 12, -1, -2, -3, -4, -6, -12
\]

### Step 2: Sum the Divisors
Next, we will sum all of these integers:

**Positive Divisors:**
\[
1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 6 + 12 = 28
\]

**Negative Divisors:**
\[
-1 - 2 - 3 - 4 - 6 - 12 = -28
\]

### Step 3: Combine the Sums
Now, we combine the sums of the positive and negative divisors:

\[
28 + (-28) = 0
\]

### Conclusion
The sum of all integers \( n \) such that \( \frac{12}{n} \) is also an integer is:

\[
\boxed{0}
\] 

This comprehensive solution addresses all aspects of the problem, clearly identifying the divisors of 12 and calculating their sum accurately.
