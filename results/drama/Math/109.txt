To determine the value of \( K \) such that the system of equations has no solutions, we need to analyze the given equations:

1. \( 6x + 4y = 7 \) (Equation 1)
2. \( Kx + 8y = 7 \) (Equation 2)

### Step 1: Write the equations in standard form

The equations are already in standard form. We can identify the coefficients:

- For Equation 1: \( a_1 = 6 \), \( b_1 = 4 \), \( c_1 = 7 \)
- For Equation 2: \( a_2 = K \), \( b_2 = 8 \), \( c_2 = 7 \)

### Step 2: Determine the condition for no solutions

For the system of equations to have no solutions, the lines represented by these equations must be parallel. This occurs when the ratios of the coefficients of \( x \) and \( y \) are equal, but the ratio of the constants is different. Mathematically, this can be expressed as:

\[
\frac{a_1}{a_2} = \frac{b_1}{b_2} \quad \text{and} \quad \frac{c_1}{c_2} \neq \frac{a_1}{a_2}
\]

### Step 3: Set up the ratios

Using the coefficients from our equations, we set up the ratios:

1. **Equal slopes condition**:
   \[
   \frac{6}{K} = \frac{4}{8}
   \]

   Simplifying the right side:
   \[
   \frac{4}{8} = \frac{1}{2}
   \]

   Thus, we have:
   \[
   \frac{6}{K} = \frac{1}{2}
   \]

### Step 4: Solve for \( K \)

Cross-multiplying gives:
\[
6 \cdot 2 = 1 \cdot K \implies 12 = K
\]

### Step 5: Check the condition for no solutions

Now we need to ensure that the second condition holds, which is that the ratios of the constants are different:

\[
\frac{c_1}{c_2} \neq \frac{a_1}{a_2}
\]

Substituting the values:
\[
\frac{7}{7} \neq \frac{6}{12}
\]

This simplifies to:
\[
1 \neq \frac{1}{2}
\]

This condition is satisfied.

### Conclusion

Thus, the value of \( K \) such that the system of equations has no solutions is:

\[
\boxed{12}
\]
