To solve the equation \(\cos(4x) = -\frac{1}{2}\), we first determine the angles where the cosine function equals \(-\frac{1}{2}\). The angles are given by:

\[
\theta = \frac{2\pi}{3} + 2k\pi \quad \text{and} \quad \theta = \frac{4\pi}{3} + 2k\pi
\]

where \(k\) is any integer.

Since we have \(\cos(4x)\), we set \(4x\) equal to these angles:

1. For the first angle:
   \[
   4x = \frac{2\pi}{3} + 2k\pi
   \]
   Dividing both sides by 4:
   \[
   x = \frac{2\pi}{12} + \frac{k\pi}{2} = \frac{\pi}{6} + \frac{k\pi}{2}
   \]

2. For the second angle:
   \[
   4x = \frac{4\pi}{3} + 2k\pi
   \]
   Dividing both sides by 4:
   \[
   x = \frac{4\pi}{12} + \frac{k\pi}{2} = \frac{\pi}{3} + \frac{k\pi}{2}
   \]

Now we have two sets of solutions for \(x\):
1. \(x = \frac{\pi}{6} + \frac{k\pi}{2}\)
2. \(x = \frac{\pi}{3} + \frac{k\pi}{2}\)

Next, we want to express these solutions in the form \(\frac{(kn \pm 1) \pi}{6}\).

### Step 1: Convert the solutions

1. **For the first solution**:
   \[
   x = \frac{\pi}{6} + \frac{k\pi}{2} = \frac{\pi}{6} + \frac{3k\pi}{6} = \frac{(1 + 3k)\pi}{6}
   \]

2. **For the second solution**:
   \[
   x = \frac{\pi}{3} + \frac{k\pi}{2} = \frac{2\pi}{6} + \frac{3k\pi}{6} = \frac{(2 + 3k)\pi}{6}
   \]

### Step 2: Identify the form \(\frac{(kn \pm 1) \pi}{6}\)

From the first solution, we can express it as:
\[
x = \frac{(3k + 1)\pi}{6}
\]
This suggests that \(k\) is a coefficient of \(n\) in this case.

From the second solution, we can express it as:
\[
x = \frac{(3k + 2)\pi}{6}
\]

### Step 3: Determine the positive value of \(k\)

To express both solutions in the form \(\frac{(kn \pm 1) \pi}{6}\), we can see that \(3k\) is the common term. 

To find the positive value of \(k\), we can set \(k = 1\) (the smallest positive integer), which gives us:

1. From the first solution:
   \[
   x = \frac{(3(1) + 1)\pi}{6} = \frac{4\pi}{6} = \frac{2\pi}{3}
   \]

2. From the second solution:
   \[
   x = \frac{(3(1) + 2)\pi}{6} = \frac{5\pi}{6}
   \]

Thus, the positive value of \(k\) that satisfies the requirement to express the solutions in the form \(\frac{(kn \pm 1) \pi}{6}\) is:

\[
\boxed{3}
\] 

This means that \(k\) can be taken as \(3\) in the context of the solutions derived from the original equation.
