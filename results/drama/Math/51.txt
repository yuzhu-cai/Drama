To solve the problem of how many apples Betty and Cathy will have together when splitting 36 apples in the ratio of 2:3:3:4, we will follow these steps:

### Step 1: Determine the Total Parts of the Ratio
The ratio of apples for Amy, Betty, Cathy, and Daisy is given as 2:3:3:4. 

Calculating the total parts:
\[
\text{Total parts} = 2 + 3 + 3 + 4 = 12
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the Value of One Part
Now, we will find the value of one part by dividing the total number of apples by the total parts:
\[
\text{Value of one part} = \frac{\text{Total number of apples}}{\text{Total parts}} = \frac{36}{12} = 3
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the Number of Apples for Betty and Cathy
Now we can calculate how many apples Betty and Cathy will receive based on their respective parts in the ratio.

- **Betty's ratio part** is 3:
\[
\text{Betty's share} = 3 \times \text{Value of one part} = 3 \times 3 = 9
\]

- **Cathy's ratio part** is also 3:
\[
\text{Cathy's share} = 3 \times \text{Value of one part} = 3 \times 3 = 9
\]

### Step 4: Calculate the Total Apples for Betty and Cathy Together
Now, we can find the total number of apples that Betty and Cathy have together:
\[
\text{Total for Betty and Cathy} = \text{Betty's share} + \text{Cathy's share} = 9 + 9 = 18
\]

### Conclusion
Betty and Cathy will have a total of **18 apples** together.
