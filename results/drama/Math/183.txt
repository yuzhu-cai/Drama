To determine the greatest common factor (GCF) of \(5!\), \(10!\), and \(15!\), we will follow a systematic approach based on the prime factorization of each factorial.

### Step 1: Calculate the Factorials

1. **Calculate \(5!\)**:
   \[
   5! = 5 \times 4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1 = 120
   \]
   The prime factorization of \(120\) is:
   \[
   120 = 2^3 \times 3^1 \times 5^1
   \]

2. **Calculate \(10!\)**:
   \[
   10! = 10 \times 9 \times 8 \times 7 \times 6 \times 5 \times 4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1
   \]
   The prime factorization of \(10!\) is:
   \[
   10! = 2^8 \times 3^4 \times 5^2 \times 7^1
   \]

3. **Calculate \(15!\)**:
   \[
   15! = 15 \times 14 \times 13 \times 12 \times 11 \times 10 \times 9 \times 8 \times 7 \times 6 \times 5 \times 4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1
   \]
   The prime factorization of \(15!\) is:
   \[
   15! = 2^{11} \times 3^6 \times 5^3 \times 7^2 \times 11^1 \times 13^1
   \]

### Step 2: Identify Common Prime Factors

Next, we identify the common prime factors among \(5!\), \(10!\), and \(15!\):

- **Prime factors of \(5!\)**: \(2, 3, 5\)
- **Prime factors of \(10!\)**: \(2, 3, 5, 7\)
- **Prime factors of \(15!\)**: \(2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13\)

The common prime factors are:
\[
2, 3, 5
\]

### Step 3: Determine the Lowest Power of Each Common Prime Factor

Now, we will take the lowest power of each common prime factor from the factorizations:

- For \(2\):
  - \(5!\): \(2^3\)
  - \(10!\): \(2^8\)
  - \(15!\): \(2^{11}\)
  - **Lowest power**: \(2^3\)

- For \(3\):
  - \(5!\): \(3^1\)
  - \(10!\): \(3^4\)
  - \(15!\): \(3^6\)
  - **Lowest power**: \(3^1\)

- For \(5\):
  - \(5!\): \(5^1\)
  - \(10!\): \(5^2\)
  - \(15!\): \(5^3\)
  - **Lowest power**: \(5^1\)

### Step 4: Calculate the GCF

Now, we multiply the common prime factors raised to their lowest powers:
\[
\text{GCF} = 2^3 \times 3^1 \times 5^1
\]

Calculating this:
\[
\text{GCF} = 8 \times 3 \times 5
\]
\[
= 24 \times 5 = 120
\]

### Conclusion

The greatest common factor (GCF) of \(5!\), \(10!\), and \(15!\) is:
\[
\boxed{120}
\] 

This comprehensive solution addresses all aspects of the problem, providing a clear and accurate calculation of the GCF based on the prime factorization of the factorials involved.
