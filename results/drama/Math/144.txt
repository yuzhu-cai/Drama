To solve the problem \(81_9 - 72_9\) and express the answer in base 9, we will follow these steps:

1. **Convert \(81_9\) and \(72_9\) from base 9 to base 10.**
2. **Perform the subtraction in base 10.**
3. **Convert the result back from base 10 to base 9.**

### Step 1: Convert \(81_9\) and \(72_9\) to base 10

**Converting \(81_9\):**
\[
81_9 = 8 \cdot 9^1 + 1 \cdot 9^0 = 8 \cdot 9 + 1 \cdot 1 = 72 + 1 = 73
\]

**Converting \(72_9\):**
\[
72_9 = 7 \cdot 9^1 + 2 \cdot 9^0 = 7 \cdot 9 + 2 \cdot 1 = 63 + 2 = 65
\]

### Step 2: Perform the subtraction in base 10
Now we subtract the two base 10 numbers obtained:
\[
73 - 65 = 8
\]

### Step 3: Convert the result back from base 10 to base 9
Now we need to convert \(8\) from base 10 to base 9. 

Since \(8\) is less than \(9\), it can be directly represented in base 9 as:
\[
8_{10} = 8_9
\]

### Final Result
Thus, the result of \(81_9 - 72_9\) expressed in base 9 is:
\[
\boxed{8_9}
\] 

This solution clearly outlines each step taken to arrive at the final answer, ensuring accuracy and clarity throughout the process.
