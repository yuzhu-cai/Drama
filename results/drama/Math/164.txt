To find the value of \( x \) for the triangle with vertices at \( (0, 0) \), \( (x, 0) \), and \( (x, 5) \) such that the area is 30 square units, we can follow these steps:

### Step 1: Determine the Area Formula

The area \( A \) of a triangle can be calculated using the formula:

\[
A = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{base} \times \text{height}
\]

### Step 2: Identify Base and Height

For the given triangle:
- The base is the horizontal distance between the points \( (0, 0) \) and \( (x, 0) \), which is \( x \).
- The height is the vertical distance from the point \( (x, 5) \) to the base, which is \( 5 \).

### Step 3: Set Up the Area Equation

Given that the area is 30 square units, we can set up the equation:

\[
30 = \frac{1}{2} \times x \times 5
\]

### Step 4: Solve for \( x \)

Now, we can solve for \( x \):

1. Multiply both sides by 2 to eliminate the fraction:

\[
60 = x \times 5
\]

2. Divide both sides by 5:

\[
x = \frac{60}{5} = 12
\]

### Step 5: Verify the Solution

To verify, we can substitute \( x = 12 \) back into the area formula:

- Base = \( 12 \)
- Height = \( 5 \)

Calculating the area:

\[
A = \frac{1}{2} \times 12 \times 5 = \frac{1}{2} \times 60 = 30 \text{ square units}
\]

### Conclusion

The calculated area matches the given area of 30 square units, confirming that our solution is correct. 

Thus, the value of \( x \) is:

\[
\boxed{12}
\]
