To solve the original query, we first need to summarize the findings regarding \( T \), which is defined as the smallest positive multiple of 14 that consists only of the digits 1 and 0.

### Step 1: Identify \( T \)

Through our previous analysis, we found that the smallest positive multiple of 14 that consists only of the digits 1 and 0 is:

\[
T = 111000
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the Quotient of \( T \) Divided by 14

Now, we need to calculate the quotient when \( T \) is divided by 14:

\[
\text{Quotient} = \frac{T}{14} = \frac{111000}{14}
\]

### Step 3: Perform the Division

Now, we will perform the division:

1. **Calculate \( 111000 \div 14 \)**:
   \[
   111000 \div 14 = 7928.57142857 \ldots
   \]

However, since we are looking for the integer quotient, we will perform the integer division:

\[
\text{Integer Quotient} = 111000 \div 14 = 7928
\]

### Conclusion

Thus, the quotient when \( T \) (the smallest positive multiple of 14 consisting only of the digits 1 and 0) is divided by 14 is:

\[
\boxed{7928}
\] 

This solution clearly outlines the identification of \( T \) and the calculation of the quotient, addressing all aspects of the problem accurately.
