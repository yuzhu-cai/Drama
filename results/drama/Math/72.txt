To solve the problem where \( x \), \( y \), and \( z \) are positive numbers satisfying the equations \( xy = 24 \), \( xz = 48 \), and \( yz = 72 \), we will follow these steps:

### Step 1: Express \( y \) and \( z \) in terms of \( x \)

From the equations given:

1. From \( xy = 24 \):
   \[
   y = \frac{24}{x}
   \]

2. From \( xz = 48 \):
   \[
   z = \frac{48}{x}
   \]

### Step 2: Substitute \( y \) and \( z \) into the third equation

Now we substitute the expressions for \( y \) and \( z \) into the equation \( yz = 72 \):

\[
yz = \left(\frac{24}{x}\right) \left(\frac{48}{x}\right) = \frac{24 \cdot 48}{x^2}
\]

Calculating \( 24 \cdot 48 \):

\[
24 \cdot 48 = 1152
\]

Thus, we have:

\[
yz = \frac{1152}{x^2}
\]

### Step 3: Set the equation equal to 72

Now we set this equal to 72:

\[
\frac{1152}{x^2} = 72
\]

### Step 4: Solve for \( x^2 \)

Multiply both sides by \( x^2 \):

\[
1152 = 72x^2
\]

Now divide both sides by 72:

\[
x^2 = \frac{1152}{72}
\]

Calculating \( \frac{1152}{72} \):

\[
\frac{1152}{72} = 16
\]

Thus, we find:

\[
x^2 = 16 \implies x = 4 \quad (\text{since } x \text{ is positive})
\]

### Step 5: Calculate \( y \) and \( z \)

Now we can substitute \( x = 4 \) back into the expressions for \( y \) and \( z \):

1. For \( y \):
   \[
   y = \frac{24}{x} = \frac{24}{4} = 6
   \]

2. For \( z \):
   \[
   z = \frac{48}{x} = \frac{48}{4} = 12
   \]

### Step 6: Calculate \( x + y + z \)

Now we can find the sum:

\[
x + y + z = 4 + 6 + 12
\]

Calculating the sum:

\[
x + y + z = 22
\]

### Conclusion

Thus, the final result is:

\[
\boxed{22}
\] 

This comprehensive solution addresses all aspects of the problem and confirms that \( x + y + z = 22 \).
