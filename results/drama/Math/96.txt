To find the power to which \(10\) is raised in the expression \(\frac{\sqrt{10}}{\sqrt[4]{10}}\), we first simplify the expression step by step.

1. **Rewrite the roots in exponential form**:
   - The square root of \(10\) can be expressed as:
     \[
     \sqrt{10} = 10^{1/2}.
     \]
   - The fourth root of \(10\) can be expressed as:
     \[
     \sqrt[4]{10} = 10^{1/4}.
     \]

2. **Substitute these expressions into the original fraction**:
   \[
   \frac{\sqrt{10}}{\sqrt[4]{10}} = \frac{10^{1/2}}{10^{1/4}}.
   \]

3. **Apply the property of exponents**:
   When dividing powers with the same base, we subtract the exponents:
   \[
   \frac{10^{1/2}}{10^{1/4}} = 10^{1/2 - 1/4}.
   \]

4. **Perform the subtraction of the exponents**:
   To subtract \(1/2\) and \(1/4\), we convert \(1/2\) to a fraction with a common denominator of \(4\):
   \[
   1/2 = 2/4.
   \]
   Thus,
   \[
   1/2 - 1/4 = 2/4 - 1/4 = 1/4.
   \]

5. **Rewrite the expression**:
   Therefore, we have:
   \[
   10^{1/2 - 1/4} = 10^{1/4}.
   \]

6. **Identify the value of \(x\)**:
   The expression \(\frac{\sqrt{10}}{\sqrt[4]{10}}\) simplifies to \(10^{1/4}\). Thus, in the form \(10^x\), we find that:
   \[
   x = \frac{1}{4}.
   \]

In conclusion, the expression \(\frac{\sqrt{10}}{\sqrt[4]{10}}\) equals \(10^{1/4}\), and the value of \(x\) is:
\[
\boxed{\frac{1}{4}}.
\]
