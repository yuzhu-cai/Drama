To determine how many two-digit positive integers have a product of their digits equal to 12, we can follow a systematic approach based on the analysis of the digits.

### Step 1: Define the Problem
A two-digit integer can be expressed as \( ab \), where:
- \( a \) is the tens digit (ranging from 1 to 9)
- \( b \) is the units digit (ranging from 0 to 9)

We need to find pairs of digits \( (a, b) \) such that:

\[
a \times b = 12
\]

### Step 2: Identify Valid Digit Pairs
Next, we will identify the pairs of digits \( (a, b) \) that satisfy the equation \( a \times b = 12 \). The factors of 12 that are valid digits are:

1. \( 1 \times 12 \) (not valid, as 12 is not a digit)
2. \( 2 \times 6 \) (valid)
3. \( 3 \times 4 \) (valid)
4. \( 4 \times 3 \) (valid)
5. \( 6 \times 2 \) (valid)
6. \( 12 \times 1 \) (not valid, as 12 is not a digit)

### Step 3: List Valid Two-Digit Integers
From the valid pairs identified, we can derive the corresponding two-digit integers:

- From \( 2 \times 6 \): The integer is \( 26 \).
- From \( 3 \times 4 \): The integer is \( 34 \).
- From \( 4 \times 3 \): The integer is \( 43 \).
- From \( 6 \times 2 \): The integer is \( 62 \).

### Step 4: Count the Valid Integers
Now, we will count the valid two-digit integers obtained from the pairs:

1. \( 26 \)
2. \( 34 \)
3. \( 43 \)
4. \( 62 \)

### Conclusion
In total, there are **4 two-digit positive integers** whose digits multiply to give 12. 

Thus, the final answer to the original query is:

\[
\boxed{4}
\] 

This solution comprehensively addresses the problem by clearly defining the requirements, identifying valid digit pairs, listing the resulting integers, and providing a final count of those integers.
