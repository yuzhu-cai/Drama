To find the value of \( n \) for the point \( (1001, n) \) on the line shown in the graph, we need to follow these steps:

### Step 1: Determine the Slope of the Line

From the graph, we can identify two points on the line. Let's assume we have the following points based on the grid lines:
- Point A: \( (-10, -2.71) \)
- Point B: \( (10, 8.71) \)

Using these points, we can calculate the slope \( m \) of the line using the slope formula:

\[
m = \frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1}
\]

Substituting the coordinates of points A and B:

\[
m = \frac{8.71 - (-2.71)}{10 - (-10)} = \frac{8.71 + 2.71}{10 + 10} = \frac{11.42}{20} = 0.571
\]

### Step 2: Use the Point-Slope Form to Find the Equation of the Line

Now that we have the slope \( m \), we can use the point-slope form of the equation of a line. We can use either point A or point B. Let's use point A \( (-10, -2.71) \):

\[
y - y_1 = m(x - x_1)
\]

Substituting in the values:

\[
y - (-2.71) = 0.571(x - (-10))
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
y + 2.71 = 0.571(x + 10)
\]

Distributing the slope:

\[
y + 2.71 = 0.571x + 5.71
\]

Now, isolating \( y \):

\[
y = 0.571x + 5.71 - 2.71
\]
\[
y = 0.571x + 3
\]

### Step 3: Substitute \( x = 1001 \) to Find \( n \)

Now that we have the equation of the line \( y = 0.571x + 3 \), we can substitute \( x = 1001 \) to find \( n \):

\[
n = 0.571(1001) + 3
\]

Calculating this:

\[
n = 571.571 + 3 = 574.571
\]

### Conclusion

Thus, the corresponding value of \( n \) when \( x = 1001 \) is:

\[
\boxed{574.571}
\] 

This solution synthesizes the results from the subtasks, providing a clear and accurate answer to the original query.
