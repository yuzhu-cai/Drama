To solve the equation \(\frac{x}{3} + \frac{x}{4} = 14\), we will follow a series of steps to isolate \(x\) and verify the solution.

### Step 1: Identify the Denominators
The denominators in the equation are 3 and 4.

### Step 2: Find the Least Common Multiple (LCM)
The LCM of 3 and 4 is 12.

### Step 3: Multiply Both Sides by the LCM
We will multiply every term in the equation by 12 to eliminate the fractions:

\[
12 \left(\frac{x}{3}\right) + 12 \left(\frac{x}{4}\right) = 12 \cdot 14
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
4x + 3x = 168
\]

### Step 4: Combine Like Terms
Now, combine the terms on the left side:

\[
7x = 168
\]

### Step 5: Isolate \(x\)
To solve for \(x\), divide both sides by 7:

\[
x = \frac{168}{7}
\]

Calculating the right side gives:

\[
x = 24
\]

### Step 6: Verify the Solution
Now, we will substitute \(x = 24\) back into the original equation to verify:

\[
\frac{24}{3} + \frac{24}{4} = 14
\]

Calculating each term:

\[
8 + 6 = 14
\]

Since both sides are equal, the solution is verified.

### Conclusion
The solution to the equation \(\frac{x}{3} + \frac{x}{4} = 14\) is:

\[
\boxed{24}
\] 

This comprehensive solution includes all steps taken to isolate \(x\) and confirms the accuracy of the solution through verification.
