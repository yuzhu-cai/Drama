To solve the system of equations given by:

\[
\begin{align*}
1. & \quad 4x - y + 2z = 7, \\
2. & \quad 6x + 3y + 3z = 5,
\end{align*}
\]

we will follow these steps:

### Step 1: Rearrange the first equation to express \( y \) in terms of \( x \) and \( z \).

From the first equation \( 4x - y + 2z = 7 \):

1. Rearranging gives:
   \[
   -y = 7 - 4x - 2z
   \]
2. Multiplying by -1:
   \[
   y = 4x + 2z - 7
   \]

### Step 2: Substitute \( y \) into the second equation.

Now, substitute \( y = 4x + 2z - 7 \) into the second equation \( 6x + 3y + 3z = 5 \):

1. Substitute:
   \[
   6x + 3(4x + 2z - 7) + 3z = 5
   \]
2. Distributing the 3:
   \[
   6x + 12x + 6z - 21 + 3z = 5
   \]
3. Combine like terms:
   \[
   18x + 9z - 21 = 5
   \]
4. Add 21 to both sides:
   \[
   18x + 9z = 26
   \]
5. Simplifying gives:
   \[
   2x + z = \frac{26}{9}
   \]

### Step 3: Solve for \( z \) in terms of \( x \).

From \( 2x + z = \frac{26}{9} \):
\[
z = \frac{26}{9} - 2x
\]

### Step 4: Substitute \( z \) back into the expression for \( y \).

Now substitute \( z = \frac{26}{9} - 2x \) back into the expression for \( y \):
\[
y = 4x + 2\left(\frac{26}{9} - 2x\right) - 7
\]

1. Distributing the 2:
   \[
   y = 4x + \frac{52}{9} - 4x - 7
   \]
2. Combine like terms:
   \[
   y = \frac{52}{9} - 7
   \]
3. Convert 7 to a fraction with a denominator of 9:
   \[
   7 = \frac{63}{9}
   \]
4. Thus:
   \[
   y = \frac{52}{9} - \frac{63}{9} = \frac{-11}{9}
   \]

### Final Result

The value of \( y \) in terms of \( x \) and \( z \) is:
\[
\boxed{\frac{-11}{9}}
\] 

This solution is clear and addresses all aspects of the problem, providing a comprehensive answer based on the original equations.
