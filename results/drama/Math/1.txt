To determine how many initial values \( a_0 \) lead to \( a_{2007} = a_0 \) in the sequence defined by the recursion 

\[
a_{n+1} = a_n^3 - 3a_n^2 + 3,
\]

we will follow these steps:

### Step 1: Identify the Fixed Points

First, we need to find the fixed points of the function \( f(x) = x^3 - 3x^2 + 3 \). A fixed point \( x^* \) satisfies the equation:

\[
f(x^*) = x^*.
\]

This leads to the cubic equation:

\[
x^3 - 3x^2 - x + 3 = 0.
\]

Using the Rational Root Theorem, we find that \( x = 1 \), \( x = -1 \), and \( x = 3 \) are roots of this polynomial. Thus, the fixed points are:

\[
x = 1, \quad x = -1, \quad x = 3.
\]

### Step 2: Analyze Stability of Fixed Points

Next, we compute the derivative of \( f(x) \):

\[
f'(x) = 3x^2 - 6x.
\]

Evaluating the derivative at the fixed points:

1. **At \( x = 1 \)**:
   \[
   f'(1) = 3(1)^2 - 6(1) = 3 - 6 = -3 \quad (|f'(1)| = 3 > 1 \text{, unstable})
   \]

2. **At \( x = -1 \)**:
   \[
   f'(-1) = 3(-1)^2 - 6(-1) = 3 + 6 = 9 \quad (|f'(-1)| = 9 > 1 \text{, unstable})
   \]

3. **At \( x = 3 \)**:
   \[
   f'(3) = 3(3)^2 - 6(3) = 27 - 18 = 9 \quad (|f'(3)| = 9 > 1 \text{, unstable})
   \]

Since all fixed points are unstable, any initial value \( a_0 \) close to these points will diverge away from them.

### Step 3: Determine Periodic Points

To find how many initial values \( a_0 \) lead to \( a_{2007} = a_0 \), we need to identify periodic points of the function \( f \). A point \( a \) is periodic with period \( n \) if:

\[
f^n(a) = a.
\]

### Step 4: Analyze Cycles

The periodic points will include the fixed points and potentially other cycles. We need to find cycles whose lengths divide 2007. The number 2007 can be factored as:

\[
2007 = 3^2 \times 223.
\]

The number of divisors of 2007 is calculated as follows:

\[
d(2007) = (2 + 1)(1 + 1) = 3 \times 2 = 6.
\]

### Step 5: Conclusion

The periodic points of the function \( f \) can be found by analyzing the cycles of the function. Since we have established that the fixed points are unstable, the periodic points that lead to \( a_{2007} = a_0 \) will include all cycles of lengths that divide 2007.

Thus, the total number of initial values \( a_0 \) that lead to \( a_{2007} = a_0 \) is equal to the number of divisors of 2007, which is:

\[
\boxed{6}.
\]
