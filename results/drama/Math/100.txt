To find the sum of the integers from 1 to 100, represented mathematically as \( 1 + 2 + 3 + \cdots + 98 + 99 + 100 \), we can utilize the formula for the sum of the first \( n \) natural numbers:

\[
S_n = \frac{n(n + 1)}{2}
\]

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Identify \( n \)**: In this case, \( n = 100 \) since we want to sum all natural numbers from 1 to 100.

2. **Apply the Formula**:
   \[
   S_{100} = \frac{100(100 + 1)}{2}
   \]

3. **Calculate \( 100 + 1 \)**:
   \[
   100 + 1 = 101
   \]

4. **Multiply \( 100 \) by \( 101 \)**:
   \[
   100 \times 101 = 10100
   \]

5. **Divide by \( 2 \)**:
   \[
   \frac{10100}{2} = 5050
   \]

### Conclusion:
Thus, the sum of the integers from 1 to 100 is:

\[
\boxed{5050}
\]

This comprehensive solution confirms that the sum \( 1 + 2 + 3 + \cdots + 98 + 99 + 100 \) equals 5050, utilizing the established formula for the sum of the first \( n \) natural numbers.
