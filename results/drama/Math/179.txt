To find the probability that exactly two of the six rolled dice show a 1 and exactly two show a 2, we will follow these steps:

### Step 1: Calculate the Total Number of Outcomes

When rolling six 6-sided dice, the total number of outcomes is given by:

\[
\text{Total outcomes} = 6^6 = 46656
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the Number of Favorable Outcomes

To find the number of favorable outcomes where exactly two dice show a 1 and exactly two dice show a 2, we can break this down into the following subtasks:

1. **Choose the positions for the 1s**: We need to select 2 positions from the 6 dice to show a 1. This can be calculated using the binomial coefficient:

   \[
   \binom{6}{2} = \frac{6!}{2!(6-2)!} = \frac{6 \times 5}{2 \times 1} = 15
   \]

2. **Choose the positions for the 2s**: After selecting positions for the 1s, we have 4 positions left. We need to choose 2 of these 4 positions to show a 2:

   \[
   \binom{4}{2} = \frac{4!}{2!(4-2)!} = \frac{4 \times 3}{2 \times 1} = 6
   \]

3. **Determine the outcomes for the remaining dice**: After placing the 1s and 2s, there are 2 positions left. These remaining dice can show any number from 3 to 6 (since we are only interested in the outcomes where exactly two dice show a 1 and exactly two dice show a 2). Each of the remaining 2 dice can independently take any of the 4 values (3, 4, 5, or 6):

   \[
   4^2 = 16
   \]

### Step 3: Calculate the Total Number of Favorable Outcomes

Now, we can combine these results to find the total number of favorable outcomes:

\[
\text{Total favorable outcomes} = \binom{6}{2} \times \binom{4}{2} \times 4^2 = 15 \times 6 \times 16
\]

Calculating this:

1. \( 15 \times 6 = 90 \)
2. \( 90 \times 16 = 1440 \)

So, the total number of favorable outcomes is \( 1440 \).

### Step 4: Calculate the Probability

Now we can calculate the probability of the event:

\[
P(\text{exactly two 1s and two 2s}) = \frac{\text{Number of favorable outcomes}}{\text{Total number of outcomes}} = \frac{1440}{46656}
\]

### Step 5: Simplify the Fraction

To simplify \( \frac{1440}{46656} \), we can find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 1440 and 46656.

Using the Euclidean algorithm or a calculator, we find that the GCD is 144.

Now we can simplify:

\[
\frac{1440 \div 144}{46656 \div 144} = \frac{10}{324}
\]

We can simplify \( \frac{10}{324} \) further:

\[
\frac{10 \div 2}{324 \div 2} = \frac{5}{162}
\]

### Final Answer

Thus, the probability that exactly two of the six dice show a 1 and exactly two show a 2 is:

\[
\boxed{\frac{5}{162}}
\]
