To find the area of equilateral triangle \( ABC \) given the lengths of the altitudes from point \( P \) to the sides \( AB \), \( BC \), and \( CA \) as 5, 6, and 7 respectively, we can use a specific property of equilateral triangles.

### Step 1: Understanding the Relationship

In an equilateral triangle, the area can be expressed in terms of the altitudes from any interior point to the sides of the triangle. The area \( A \) of triangle \( ABC \) can be calculated using the formula:

\[
A = \frac{1}{3} (h_a + h_b + h_c) \cdot s
\]

where \( h_a \), \( h_b \), and \( h_c \) are the lengths of the altitudes from point \( P \) to sides \( BC \), \( CA \), and \( AB \) respectively, and \( s \) is the length of a side of the equilateral triangle.

### Step 2: Calculate the Total Altitude Length

Given:
- \( h_a = 5 \)
- \( h_b = 6 \)
- \( h_c = 7 \)

We first calculate the sum of the altitudes:

\[
h_a + h_b + h_c = 5 + 6 + 7 = 18
\]

### Step 3: Relate the Area to the Altitudes

In an equilateral triangle, the area can also be expressed in terms of the side length \( s \) and the altitude \( h \) of the triangle:

\[
A = \frac{s \cdot h}{2}
\]

The altitude \( h \) of an equilateral triangle with side length \( s \) is given by:

\[
h = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} s
\]

Thus, the area can also be expressed as:

\[
A = \frac{s \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} s}{2} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} s^2
\]

### Step 4: Using the Altitudes to Find the Area

Using the property of the altitudes from point \( P \):

\[
A = \frac{1}{3} (h_a + h_b + h_c) \cdot s
\]

Substituting the sum of the altitudes:

\[
A = \frac{1}{3} \cdot 18 \cdot s = 6s
\]

### Step 5: Equating the Two Area Expressions

Now we have two expressions for the area \( A \):

1. \( A = 6s \)
2. \( A = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} s^2 \)

Setting these equal to each other:

\[
6s = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} s^2
\]

### Step 6: Solve for \( s \)

To solve for \( s \), we can rearrange the equation:

\[
\frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} s^2 - 6s = 0
\]

Factoring out \( s \):

\[
s \left( \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} s - 6 \right) = 0
\]

This gives us two solutions:

1. \( s = 0 \) (not valid)
2. \( \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} s - 6 = 0 \)

Solving for \( s \):

\[
\frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} s = 6 \implies s = \frac{6 \cdot 4}{\sqrt{3}} = \frac{24}{\sqrt{3}} = 8\sqrt{3}
\]

### Step 7: Calculate the Area

Now substituting \( s \) back into the area formula:

\[
A = 6s = 6 \cdot 8\sqrt{3} = 48\sqrt{3}
\]

### Final Result

Thus, the area of triangle \( ABC \) is:

\[
\boxed{48\sqrt{3}}
\]
