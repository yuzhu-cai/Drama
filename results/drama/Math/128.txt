To express the infinite series 

\[
\frac{3}{206} + \frac{9}{2 \cdot 103^2} + \frac{27}{2 \cdot 103^3} + \cdots
\]

as a terminating decimal, we will follow these steps:

### Step 1: Identify the First Term and Common Ratio

1. **First Term \( a \)**:
   The first term of the series is:
   \[
   a = \frac{3}{206}
   \]

2. **Common Ratio \( r \)**:
   To find the common ratio, we can look at the second term and divide it by the first term:
   \[
   r = \frac{\frac{9}{2 \cdot 103^2}}{\frac{3}{206}} = \frac{9 \cdot 206}{3 \cdot 2 \cdot 103^2} = \frac{9 \cdot 206}{6 \cdot 103^2} = \frac{3 \cdot 206}{2 \cdot 103^2} = \frac{618}{2 \cdot 103^2} = \frac{309}{103^2}
   \]
   Simplifying further, we can see that:
   \[
   r = \frac{3}{2 \cdot 103}
   \]

### Step 2: Check the Condition for Convergence

To use the formula for the sum of an infinite geometric series, we need to ensure that the absolute value of the common ratio \( |r| < 1 \):
\[
|r| = \left|\frac{3}{2 \cdot 103}\right| < 1
\]
This condition is satisfied since \( 2 \cdot 103 = 206 \) and \( 3 < 206 \).

### Step 3: Calculate the Sum of the Series

Using the formula for the sum of an infinite geometric series:
\[
S = \frac{a}{1 - r}
\]

Substituting the values of \( a \) and \( r \):
\[
S = \frac{\frac{3}{206}}{1 - \frac{3}{2 \cdot 103}} = \frac{\frac{3}{206}}{1 - \frac{3}{206}} = \frac{\frac{3}{206}}{\frac{206 - 3}{206}} = \frac{3}{206} \cdot \frac{206}{203} = \frac{3}{203}
\]

### Step 4: Convert the Resulting Sum into a Terminating Decimal

Now we need to convert \( \frac{3}{203} \) into a decimal. 

1. **Perform the Division**:
   \[
   3 \div 203 \approx 0.014792
   \]

2. **Check for Termination**:
   The fraction \( \frac{3}{203} \) does not have a denominator that consists only of the prime factors 2 and 5, as \( 203 = 7 \times 29 \). Therefore, it does not yield a terminating decimal.

### Conclusion

The infinite series 

\[
\frac{3}{206} + \frac{9}{2 \cdot 103^2} + \frac{27}{2 \cdot 103^3} + \cdots
\]

converges to the sum 

\[
S = \frac{3}{203} \approx 0.014792
\]

However, since \( \frac{3}{203} \) does not have a terminating decimal representation, the final answer remains as the fraction \( \frac{3}{203} \) or its approximate decimal representation \( 0.014792 \).
