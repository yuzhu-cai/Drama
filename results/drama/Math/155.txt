To determine the units digit of \( 2^{2010} \), we can follow a systematic approach based on the established pattern of the units digits of powers of 2.

### Step 1: Identify the Pattern

First, we calculate the units digits of the first few powers of 2:

- \( 2^1 = 2 \) → units digit is **2**
- \( 2^2 = 4 \) → units digit is **4**
- \( 2^3 = 8 \) → units digit is **8**
- \( 2^4 = 16 \) → units digit is **6**
- \( 2^5 = 32 \) → units digit is **2**
- \( 2^6 = 64 \) → units digit is **4**
- \( 2^7 = 128 \) → units digit is **8**
- \( 2^8 = 256 \) → units digit is **6**

From these calculations, we observe that the units digits repeat every four powers in the following cycle:

- **2, 4, 8, 6**

### Step 2: Determine the Position of \( 2010 \) in the Cycle

Next, we need to find out where \( 2010 \) falls within this cycle. We do this by calculating \( 2010 \mod 4 \):

\[
2010 \div 4 = 502 \quad \text{(remainder 2)}
\]

Thus, we find:

\[
2010 \mod 4 = 2
\]

### Step 3: Match the Remainder to the Units Digit

Now, we can match this remainder to the corresponding units digit in our established cycle:

- Remainder 1 corresponds to units digit **2**
- Remainder 2 corresponds to units digit **4**
- Remainder 3 corresponds to units digit **8**
- Remainder 0 corresponds to units digit **6**

Since \( 2010 \mod 4 = 2 \), we conclude that the units digit of \( 2^{2010} \) is **4**.

### Final Answer

Therefore, the units digit of \( 2^{2010} \) is \( \boxed{4} \).
