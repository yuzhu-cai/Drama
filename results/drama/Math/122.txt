To solve the problem, we need to calculate the midpoints based on the two different locations provided for Barbara and then find the positive difference in the x-coordinates of these midpoints.

### Step 1: Calculate the Midpoint of Annie's Location and Barbara's Incorrect Location

Annie's location is \( (3, 5) \) and Barbara's incorrect location is \( (-6, 2) \).

Using the midpoint formula:

\[
\text{Midpoint} = \left( \frac{x_1 + x_2}{2}, \frac{y_1 + y_2}{2} \right)
\]

Substituting the coordinates:

\[
\text{Midpoint}_{\text{incorrect}} = \left( \frac{3 + (-6)}{2}, \frac{5 + 2}{2} \right) = \left( \frac{-3}{2}, \frac{7}{2} \right) = \left( -1.5, 3.5 \right)
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the Midpoint of Annie's Location and Barbara's Correct Location

Now, using Barbara's correct location \( (-10, 4) \):

\[
\text{Midpoint}_{\text{correct}} = \left( \frac{3 + (-10)}{2}, \frac{5 + 4}{2} \right) = \left( \frac{-7}{2}, \frac{9}{2} \right) = \left( -3.5, 4.5 \right)
\]

### Step 3: Find the Positive Difference in the x-coordinates of the Two Midpoints

Now we have the x-coordinates of the two midpoints:

- \( x_{\text{incorrect}} = -1.5 \)
- \( x_{\text{correct}} = -3.5 \)

To find the positive difference in the x-coordinates:

\[
\text{Positive difference} = |x_{\text{incorrect}} - x_{\text{correct}}| = |-1.5 - (-3.5)| = |-1.5 + 3.5| = |2| = 2
\]

### Conclusion

The positive difference in the x-coordinates of where Annie and Barbara agreed to meet (based on the incorrect location) and where they should actually meet (based on the correct location) is \( \boxed{2} \).
