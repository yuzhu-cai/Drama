To solve the problem, we need to determine the translation vector that takes the point \( 5 + 5i \) to the point \( 6 + 8i \). Once we have the translation vector, we can apply it to the complex number \( -6 \) to find its new position.

### Step 1: Find the Translation Vector

The translation vector \( \mathbf{v} \) can be calculated as the difference between the two points:

\[
\mathbf{v} = (6 + 8i) - (5 + 5i)
\]

Calculating this step-by-step:

1. Subtract the real parts:
   \[
   6 - 5 = 1
   \]

2. Subtract the imaginary parts:
   \[
   8 - 5 = 3
   \]

Thus, the translation vector is:

\[
\mathbf{v} = 1 + 3i
\]

### Step 2: Apply the Translation Vector to the Complex Number \(-6\)

Next, we apply this translation vector to the complex number \( -6 \). In complex form, this is represented as:

\[
z = -6 + 0i
\]

Now, we add the translation vector \( \mathbf{v} = 1 + 3i \):

\[
z' = z + \mathbf{v} = (-6 + 0i) + (1 + 3i)
\]

Calculating this step-by-step:

1. Add the real parts:
   \[
   -6 + 1 = -5
   \]

2. Add the imaginary parts:
   \[
   0 + 3 = 3
   \]

Thus, the new position of the complex number \( -6 \) after applying the translation vector is:

\[
z' = -5 + 3i
\]

### Conclusion

The complex number that the translation takes \( -6 \) to is:

\[
\boxed{-5 + 3i}
\] 

This solution clearly outlines the steps taken to find the translation vector and apply it to the given complex number, providing a comprehensive answer to the original query.
