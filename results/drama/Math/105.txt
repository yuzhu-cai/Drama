To find \( k \) in the equation \((3^k)^6 = 3^6\), we can follow these steps:

1. **Apply the Power of a Power Property**: 
   We start with the left side of the equation:
   \[
   (3^k)^6
   \]
   According to the property of exponents \((a^m)^n = a^{m \cdot n}\), we can simplify this to:
   \[
   3^{k \cdot 6} = 3^{6k}
   \]

2. **Rewrite the Equation**:
   Now, we can rewrite the original equation:
   \[
   3^{6k} = 3^6
   \]

3. **Set the Exponents Equal**:
   Since the bases are the same (both are base 3), we can set the exponents equal to each other:
   \[
   6k = 6
   \]

4. **Solve for \( k \)**:
   To isolate \( k \), divide both sides of the equation by 6:
   \[
   k = 1
   \]

5. **Conclusion**:
   The solution to the equation \((3^k)^6 = 3^6\) is:
   \[
   \boxed{1}
   \]

This comprehensive solution clearly outlines each step taken to arrive at the final answer, ensuring that all aspects of the problem are addressed accurately.
