To solve the problem, we have two key pieces of information about the real numbers \( x \) and \( y \):

1. The arithmetic mean of \( x \) and \( y \) is 7:
   \[
   \frac{x + y}{2} = 7
   \]
   From this, we can derive:
   \[
   x + y = 14 \quad \text{(Equation 1)}
   \]

2. The geometric mean of \( x \) and \( y \) is \( \sqrt{19} \):
   \[
   \sqrt{x \cdot y} = \sqrt{19}
   \]
   Squaring both sides gives us:
   \[
   x \cdot y = 19 \quad \text{(Equation 2)}
   \]

Now, we need to find \( x^2 + y^2 \). We can use the identity:
\[
x^2 + y^2 = (x + y)^2 - 2xy
\]

### Step 1: Calculate \( (x + y)^2 \)
Using Equation 1:
\[
(x + y)^2 = 14^2 = 196
\]

### Step 2: Calculate \( 2xy \)
Using Equation 2:
\[
2xy = 2 \cdot 19 = 38
\]

### Step 3: Substitute into the identity
Now we substitute these values into the identity:
\[
x^2 + y^2 = (x + y)^2 - 2xy
\]
\[
x^2 + y^2 = 196 - 38
\]
\[
x^2 + y^2 = 158
\]

### Conclusion
Thus, the value of \( x^2 + y^2 \) is:
\[
\boxed{158}
\] 

This solution comprehensively addresses the problem by deriving the necessary equations from the given means, applying the identity for \( x^2 + y^2 \), and calculating the final result accurately.
