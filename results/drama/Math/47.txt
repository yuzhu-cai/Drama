To solve the original query, we need to simplify the expression \(\frac{3a^2b}{5ac} \times \frac{10c}{6ab}\). We will follow these steps:

1. **Simplify each fraction** (which we have already done):
   - The first fraction \(\frac{3a^2b}{5ac}\) simplifies to \(\frac{3ab}{5c}\).
   - The second fraction \(\frac{10c}{6ab}\) simplifies to \(\frac{5c}{3ab}\).

2. **Multiply the simplified fractions**:
   Now we multiply the two simplified fractions:
   \[
   \frac{3ab}{5c} \times \frac{5c}{3ab}
   \]

3. **Multiply the numerators and denominators**:
   \[
   = \frac{3ab \cdot 5c}{5c \cdot 3ab}
   \]

4. **Cancel common factors**:
   In this multiplication, we can see that \(3ab\) in the numerator and denominator cancels out, as well as \(5c\):
   \[
   = \frac{(3ab) \cdot (5c)}{(5c) \cdot (3ab)} = 1
   \]

5. **Final result**:
   Therefore, the final result of the expression \(\frac{3a^2b}{5ac} \times \frac{10c}{6ab}\) is:
   \[
   \boxed{1}
   \]

This comprehensive solution shows that the product of the two simplified fractions results in \(1\), confirming that the original expression simplifies completely.
