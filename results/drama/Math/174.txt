To find the total volume of the solid formed by a cylinder and a cone, we will synthesize the results from the calculations of their individual volumes.

### Given Dimensions
- **Radius** of both the cylinder and the cone: \( r = \sqrt{3} \)
- **Height of the cylinder**: \( h_c = 10 \)
- **Height of the cone**: \( h_{cone} = 10 \)

### Step 1: Calculate the Volume of the Cylinder
The volume \( V_c \) of the cylinder is calculated using the formula:
\[
V_c = \pi r^2 h_c
\]
Substituting the values:
\[
V_c = \pi (\sqrt{3})^2 (10) = \pi (3)(10) = 30\pi
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the Volume of the Cone
The volume \( V_{cone} \) of the cone is calculated using the formula:
\[
V_{cone} = \frac{1}{3} \pi r^2 h_{cone}
\]
Substituting the values:
\[
V_{cone} = \frac{1}{3} \pi (\sqrt{3})^2 (10) = \frac{1}{3} \pi (3)(10) = 10\pi
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the Total Volume of the Solid
Now, we add the volumes of the cylinder and the cone to find the total volume \( V_{total} \):
\[
V_{total} = V_c + V_{cone}
\]
Substituting the calculated volumes:
\[
V_{total} = 30\pi + 10\pi = 40\pi
\]

### Final Result
Thus, the total volume of the solid, which consists of both the cylinder and the cone, is:

\[
\boxed{40\pi}
\] 

This solution clearly outlines the steps taken to arrive at the total volume, ensuring that all aspects of the problem are addressed accurately.
