To determine the value of the constant \( c \) such that the quadratic expression \( x^2 + 25x + c \) can be expressed as the square of a binomial, we follow these steps:

### Step 1: Identify the Form of the Binomial Square

A binomial square can be expressed in the form:

\[
(x + a)^2 = x^2 + 2ax + a^2
\]

### Step 2: Compare Coefficients

We want to match the coefficients of the expression \( x^2 + 25x + c \) with those from the expanded binomial square:

1. The coefficient of \( x^2 \) is \( 1 \), which matches.
2. The coefficient of \( x \) gives us the equation:
   \[
   2a = 25
   \]
3. The constant term corresponds to:
   \[
   c = a^2
   \]

### Step 3: Solve for \( a \)

From the equation \( 2a = 25 \):

\[
a = \frac{25}{2} = 12.5
\]

### Step 4: Calculate \( c \)

Now, substituting \( a \) back into the equation for \( c \):

\[
c = a^2 = \left(\frac{25}{2}\right)^2 = \frac{625}{4} = 156.25
\]

### Conclusion

Thus, the value of \( c \) such that the expression \( x^2 + 25x + c \) is equal to the square of a binomial is:

\[
\boxed{156.25}
\]

This solution confirms that the quadratic can indeed be expressed as a binomial square, specifically as:

\[
\left(x + \frac{25}{2}\right)^2
\] 

This comprehensive approach ensures that all aspects of the problem are addressed clearly and accurately.
