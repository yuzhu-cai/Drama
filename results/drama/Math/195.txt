To determine the number of ways to distribute 4 indistinguishable balls into 2 distinguishable boxes, we can apply the stars and bars theorem, which is a well-known combinatorial method.

### Problem Breakdown:

1. **Indistinguishable Objects**: We have 4 indistinguishable balls.
2. **Distinguishable Boxes**: We have 2 distinguishable boxes.

### Application of Stars and Bars Theorem:

According to the stars and bars theorem, the number of ways to distribute \( n \) indistinguishable objects into \( k \) distinguishable boxes is given by the formula:

\[
\binom{n + k - 1}{k - 1}
\]

Where:
- \( n \) is the number of indistinguishable objects (balls),
- \( k \) is the number of distinguishable boxes.

### Substituting Values:

In our case:
- \( n = 4 \) (the number of balls),
- \( k = 2 \) (the number of boxes).

We can substitute these values into the formula:

\[
\text{Number of distributions} = \binom{4 + 2 - 1}{2 - 1} = \binom{5}{1}
\]

### Calculation of the Binomial Coefficient:

Now, we calculate \( \binom{5}{1} \):

\[
\binom{5}{1} = 5
\]

### Conclusion:

Thus, the number of ways to distribute 4 indistinguishable balls into 2 distinguishable boxes is **5**.

### Summary of Distributions:

The different distributions can be represented as follows:
1. All 4 balls in Box 1 and 0 in Box 2: \( (4, 0) \)
2. 3 balls in Box 1 and 1 in Box 2: \( (3, 1) \)
3. 2 balls in Box 1 and 2 in Box 2: \( (2, 2) \)
4. 1 ball in Box 1 and 3 in Box 2: \( (1, 3) \)
5. 0 balls in Box 1 and 4 in Box 2: \( (0, 4) \)

Each of these arrangements corresponds to one of the 5 ways to distribute the balls.

This comprehensive solution addresses all aspects of the problem, confirming that there are **5 distinct ways** to distribute 4 indistinguishable balls into 2 distinguishable boxes.
