To find the common root of the polynomials \( P(x) = x^2 - 7x + b \) and \( Q(x) = x^2 + 2x - 2b \), we will follow these steps:

### Step 1: Set the Polynomials Equal to Each Other

Since both polynomials have a common root, we can set them equal to each other:

\[
x^2 - 7x + b = x^2 + 2x - 2b
\]

### Step 2: Simplify the Equation

Subtract \( x^2 \) from both sides:

\[
-7x + b = 2x - 2b
\]

Rearranging gives:

\[
b + 2b = 2x + 7x
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
3b = 9x
\]

### Step 3: Solve for \( b \)

From the equation \( 3b = 9x \), we can express \( b \) in terms of \( x \):

\[
b = 3x
\]

### Step 4: Substitute \( b \) Back into One of the Polynomials

Now, we substitute \( b = 3x \) back into one of the original polynomial equations. Let's use \( P(x) \):

\[
P(x) = x^2 - 7x + 3x = x^2 - 4x
\]

### Step 5: Factor the Polynomial

Factoring \( P(x) \):

\[
P(x) = x(x - 4)
\]

### Step 6: Find the Roots of \( P(x) \)

Setting \( P(x) = 0 \):

\[
x(x - 4) = 0
\]

This gives us the roots:

\[
x = 0 \quad \text{or} \quad x = 4
\]

### Step 7: Find Corresponding Values of \( b \)

Now, we can find the corresponding values of \( b \) for each root:

1. For \( x = 0 \):
   \[
   b = 3(0) = 0
   \]

2. For \( x = 4 \):
   \[
   b = 3(4) = 12
   \]

### Step 8: Verify the Common Roots

Now we need to verify that these values of \( b \) yield a common root in both polynomials.

**For \( b = 0 \)**:

- \( P(x) = x^2 - 7x + 0 = x(x - 7) \) (roots: \( 0, 7 \))
- \( Q(x) = x^2 + 2x - 0 = x(x + 2) \) (roots: \( 0, -2 \))

Common root: \( 0 \)

**For \( b = 12 \)**:

- \( P(x) = x^2 - 7x + 12 = (x - 3)(x - 4) \) (roots: \( 3, 4 \))
- \( Q(x) = x^2 + 2x - 24 = (x - 4)(x + 6) \) (roots: \( 4, -6 \))

Common root: \( 4 \)

### Final Result

The possible values of the common root for the polynomials \( x^2 - 7x + b = 0 \) and \( x^2 + 2x - 2b = 0 \) are:

\[
\boxed{0, 4}
\] 

This comprehensive solution addresses all aspects of the problem, providing the values of the common root clearly and accurately.
