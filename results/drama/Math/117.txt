To solve the equation 

\[
\frac{2}{x} - \frac{3}{5} + \frac{1}{x} = \frac{1}{5},
\]

we will follow these steps:

### Step 1: Combine the fractions on the left side

First, we combine the terms involving \( x \):

\[
\frac{2}{x} + \frac{1}{x} = \frac{2 + 1}{x} = \frac{3}{x}.
\]

Now, we can rewrite the equation as:

\[
\frac{3}{x} - \frac{3}{5} = \frac{1}{5}.
\]

### Step 2: Move all terms involving \( x \) to one side

Next, we can add \( \frac{3}{5} \) to both sides to isolate the term with \( x \):

\[
\frac{3}{x} = \frac{1}{5} + \frac{3}{5}.
\]

### Step 3: Simplify the right side

Now, simplify the right side:

\[
\frac{3}{x} = \frac{1 + 3}{5} = \frac{4}{5}.
\]

### Step 4: Solve for \( x \)

To solve for \( x \), we can cross-multiply:

\[
3 \cdot 5 = 4 \cdot x.
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
15 = 4x.
\]

Now, divide both sides by 4:

\[
x = \frac{15}{4}.
\]

### Step 5: Verify the solution

Now, we will substitute \( x = \frac{15}{4} \) back into the original equation to verify:

1. Substitute \( x \) into the left side:

\[
\frac{2}{\frac{15}{4}} - \frac{3}{5} + \frac{1}{\frac{15}{4}}.
\]

2. Simplify each term:

\[
\frac{2 \cdot 4}{15} - \frac{3}{5} + \frac{4}{15} = \frac{8}{15} - \frac{3}{5} + \frac{4}{15}.
\]

3. Convert \( \frac{3}{5} \) to a fraction with a denominator of 15:

\[
\frac{3}{5} = \frac{9}{15}.
\]

4. Now substitute this back into the equation:

\[
\frac{8}{15} - \frac{9}{15} + \frac{4}{15} = \frac{8 - 9 + 4}{15} = \frac{3}{15} = \frac{1}{5}.
\]

Since both sides of the original equation are equal, the solution is verified.

### Final Answer

Thus, the solution to the equation 

\[
\frac{2}{x} - \frac{3}{5} + \frac{1}{x} = \frac{1}{5}
\]

is 

\[
\boxed{\frac{15}{4}}.
