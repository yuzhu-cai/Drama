To find the minimum height \( h \) of a right cylindrical container that can hold all the milk from a hemispherical cup with a radius of 3 inches, we will follow these steps:

### Step 1: Calculate the Volume of the Hemispherical Cup

The volume \( V_h \) of a hemispherical cup is given by the formula:

\[
V_h = \frac{2}{3} \pi r^3
\]

For a hemispherical cup with a radius \( r = 3 \) inches:

\[
V_h = \frac{2}{3} \pi (3)^3
\]

Calculating \( (3)^3 \):

\[
(3)^3 = 27
\]

Now substituting back into the volume formula:

\[
V_h = \frac{2}{3} \pi (27) = \frac{54}{3} \pi = 18\pi \text{ cubic inches}
\]

### Step 2: Set the Volume of the Cylinder Equal to the Volume of the Hemisphere

The volume \( V_c \) of a right cylindrical container is given by:

\[
V_c = \pi r^2 h
\]

For a cylindrical container with a radius \( r = 2 \) inches, we set the volume equal to the volume of the hemispherical cup:

\[
\pi (2)^2 h = 18\pi
\]

### Step 3: Simplify the Equation

Dividing both sides by \( \pi \) (assuming \( \pi \neq 0 \)):

\[
(2)^2 h = 18
\]

Calculating \( (2)^2 \):

\[
4h = 18
\]

### Step 4: Solve for Height \( h \)

Now, divide both sides by 4 to find \( h \):

\[
h = \frac{18}{4} = 4.5 \text{ inches}
\]

### Final Result

Thus, the minimum height \( h \) of the cylindrical container that can hold all the milk from the hemispherical cup is:

\[
\boxed{4.5} \text{ inches}
\]

This answer is rounded to the nearest tenth as requested.
