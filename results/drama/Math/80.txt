To solve the problem, we start with the given conditions and derive the necessary results step by step.

### Step 1: Condition for Pure Imaginary
We know that \(\frac{z_2}{z_1}\) is pure imaginary. From our previous analysis, this condition can be expressed as:
\[
x_2 x_1 + y_2 y_1 = 0
\]
where \(z_1 = x_1 + iy_1\) and \(z_2 = x_2 + iy_2\).

### Step 2: Expressing \(z_2\) in terms of \(z_1\)
From the condition \(x_2 x_1 + y_2 y_1 = 0\), we can express \(x_2\) in terms of \(y_2\) and \(z_1\):
\[
x_2 = -\frac{y_2 y_1}{x_1}
\]
This gives us a relationship between \(z_1\) and \(z_2\).

### Step 3: Compute the Magnitude
We need to compute:
\[
\left| \frac{2z_1 + 7z_2}{2z_1 - 7z_2} \right|
\]

Substituting \(z_2\) into the expression, we have:
\[
\left| \frac{2z_1 + 7z_2}{2z_1 - 7z_2} \right| = \left| \frac{2z_1 + 7(-\frac{y_2 y_1}{x_1} + iy_2)}{2z_1 - 7(-\frac{y_2 y_1}{x_1} + iy_2)} \right|
\]

However, we can simplify this without substituting directly. We can analyze the expression directly.

### Step 4: Simplifying the Expression
Letâ€™s denote \(z_1\) and \(z_2\) as complex numbers:
\[
z_1 = x_1 + iy_1, \quad z_2 = x_2 + iy_2
\]

Then, we can write:
\[
2z_1 + 7z_2 = 2(x_1 + iy_1) + 7(x_2 + iy_2) = (2x_1 + 7x_2) + i(2y_1 + 7y_2)
\]
\[
2z_1 - 7z_2 = 2(x_1 + iy_1) - 7(x_2 + iy_2) = (2x_1 - 7x_2) + i(2y_1 - 7y_2)
\]

### Step 5: Magnitude Calculation
The magnitude of a complex number \(\frac{a + bi}{c + di}\) is given by:
\[
\left| \frac{a + bi}{c + di} \right| = \frac{\sqrt{a^2 + b^2}}{\sqrt{c^2 + d^2}}
\]

Thus, we compute:
\[
\left| \frac{2z_1 + 7z_2}{2z_1 - 7z_2} \right| = \frac{\sqrt{(2x_1 + 7x_2)^2 + (2y_1 + 7y_2)^2}}{\sqrt{(2x_1 - 7x_2)^2 + (2y_1 - 7y_2)^2}}
\]

### Step 6: Verifying the Condition \(2z_1 \neq 7z_2\)
We need to ensure that \(2z_1 \neq 7z_2\). This condition implies that the two complex numbers do not represent the same point in the complex plane. If they were equal, it would contradict the condition that \(\frac{z_2}{z_1}\) is pure imaginary.

### Final Result
Thus, the final result for the magnitude is:
\[
\left| \frac{2z_1 + 7z_2}{2z_1 - 7z_2} \right|
\]
is computed as described, ensuring that \(2z_1 \neq 7z_2\) holds true, confirming that the expression is valid and does not lead to division by zero.
