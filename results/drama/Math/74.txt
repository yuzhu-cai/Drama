To solve the problem, we need to analyze the relationship between the distances \( PF \) and \( PQ \) given the condition \( \frac{PF}{PQ} = \frac{4}{5} \) and find the area of the region formed by the curve traced by point \( P \).

### Step 1: Define the Points and Distances

1. **Point Definitions**:
   - Let \( F = (4, 0) \).
   - Let \( P = (x, y) \).
   - The projection of \( P \) onto the line \( x = \frac{25}{4} \) gives us point \( Q = \left(\frac{25}{4}, y\right) \).

2. **Distance Calculations**:
   - The distance \( PF \) is calculated as:
     \[
     PF = \sqrt{(x - 4)^2 + (y - 0)^2} = \sqrt{(x - 4)^2 + y^2}
     \]
   - The distance \( PQ \) is calculated as:
     \[
     PQ = \sqrt{\left(x - \frac{25}{4}\right)^2 + (y - y)^2} = \left| x - \frac{25}{4} \right|
     \]

### Step 2: Set Up the Ratio Equation

Given the ratio \( \frac{PF}{PQ} = \frac{4}{5} \), we can set up the equation:

\[
\frac{\sqrt{(x - 4)^2 + y^2}}{\left| x - \frac{25}{4} \right|} = \frac{4}{5}
\]

Cross-multiplying gives:

\[
5 \sqrt{(x - 4)^2 + y^2} = 4 \left| x - \frac{25}{4} \right|
\]

### Step 3: Square Both Sides

Squaring both sides to eliminate the square root:

\[
25 \left((x - 4)^2 + y^2\right) = 16 \left(x - \frac{25}{4}\right)^2
\]

### Step 4: Expand and Simplify

1. **Left Side**:
   \[
   25 \left((x - 4)^2 + y^2\right) = 25(x^2 - 8x + 16 + y^2) = 25x^2 - 200x + 400 + 25y^2
   \]

2. **Right Side**:
   \[
   16 \left(x - \frac{25}{4}\right)^2 = 16 \left(x^2 - \frac{50}{4}x + \frac{625}{16}\right) = 16x^2 - 200x + 625
   \]

### Step 5: Set the Equation

Setting both sides equal:

\[
25x^2 - 200x + 400 + 25y^2 = 16x^2 - 200x + 625
\]

### Step 6: Rearranging the Equation

Rearranging gives:

\[
(25x^2 - 16x^2) + 25y^2 + 400 - 625 = 0
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
9x^2 + 25y^2 - 225 = 0
\]

### Step 7: Identify the Curve

Rearranging gives:

\[
\frac{x^2}{25} + \frac{y^2}{9} = 1
\]

This is the equation of an ellipse centered at the origin with semi-major axis \( 5 \) (along the x-axis) and semi-minor axis \( 3 \) (along the y-axis).

### Step 8: Calculate the Area of the Ellipse

The area \( A \) of an ellipse is given by the formula:

\[
A = \pi \times a \times b
\]

where \( a \) is the semi-major axis and \( b \) is the semi-minor axis. Thus:

\[
A = \pi \times 5 \times 3 = 15\pi
\]

### Final Solution

The area of the region formed by the curve traced by point \( P \) is:

\[
\boxed{15\pi}
\]
