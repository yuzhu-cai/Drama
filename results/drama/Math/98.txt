To find the smallest integer \( x \) such that the expression \(\frac{\sqrt{x-2}}{x^2+x-6}\) is defined, we need to consider the conditions derived from both the numerator and the denominator.

### Step 1: Analyze the Numerator
The numerator \(\sqrt{x-2}\) is defined when:
\[
x - 2 \geq 0 \implies x \geq 2.
\]

### Step 2: Analyze the Denominator
The denominator \(x^2 + x - 6\) must not be zero. We previously solved the equation:
\[
x^2 + x - 6 = 0
\]
Factoring gives:
\[
(x - 2)(x + 3) = 0.
\]
This results in the solutions:
\[
x = 2 \quad \text{and} \quad x = -3.
\]
Thus, the denominator is zero at \(x = 2\) and \(x = -3\). Therefore, we must exclude these values from our consideration.

### Step 3: Combine Conditions
From the analysis:
- The condition \(x \geq 2\) from the numerator means we start considering integers from \(2\) onward.
- The condition that the denominator is not zero excludes \(x = 2\).

### Step 4: Identify the Smallest Integer
Given the conditions:
- The smallest integer \( x \) that satisfies \( x \geq 2 \) is \( x = 2\), but since \( x = 2 \) makes the denominator zero, we must move to the next integer.
- The next integer is \( x = 3\).

### Conclusion
Thus, the smallest integer \( x \) such that the expression \(\frac{\sqrt{x-2}}{x^2+x-6}\) is defined is:
\[
\boxed{3}.
