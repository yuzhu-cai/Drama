To find the smallest positive real number \( a \) such that the polynomial 

\[
P(x) = x^6 + 3ax^5 + (3a^2 + 3)x^4 + (a^3 + 6a)x^3 + (3a^2 + 3)x^2 + 3ax + 1 = 0
\]

has at least one real root, we will analyze the polynomial using the following steps:

### Step 1: Analyze the Polynomial

The polynomial \( P(x) \) is a degree 6 polynomial, which means it can have up to 6 real roots. To ensure that it has at least one real root, we can use the **Intermediate Value Theorem** or analyze the behavior of the polynomial at specific points.

### Step 2: Evaluate the Polynomial at Specific Points

Let's evaluate \( P(x) \) at \( x = 0 \) and \( x = -1 \):

1. **At \( x = 0 \)**:
   \[
   P(0) = 1
   \]

2. **At \( x = -1 \)**:
   \[
   P(-1) = (-1)^6 + 3a(-1)^5 + (3a^2 + 3)(-1)^4 + (a^3 + 6a)(-1)^3 + (3a^2 + 3)(-1)^2 + 3a(-1) + 1
   \]
   Simplifying this:
   \[
   P(-1) = 1 - 3a + (3a^2 + 3) - (a^3 + 6a) + (3a^2 + 3) - 3a + 1
   \]
   \[
   = 1 - 3a + 3a^2 + 3 - a^3 - 6a + 3a^2 + 3 - 3a + 1
   \]
   \[
   = 1 - a^3 + 6a^2 - 12a + 8
   \]

Thus, we have:

\[
P(-1) = -a^3 + 6a^2 - 12a + 8
\]

### Step 3: Set Conditions for Roots

For \( P(x) \) to have at least one real root, we need \( P(0) \) and \( P(-1) \) to have opposite signs. Since \( P(0) = 1 \), we need:

\[
P(-1) < 0
\]

This leads to the inequality:

\[
-a^3 + 6a^2 - 12a + 8 < 0
\]

### Step 4: Solve the Inequality

Rearranging gives:

\[
-a^3 + 6a^2 - 12a + 8 < 0 \implies a^3 - 6a^2 + 12a - 8 > 0
\]

Now, we will find the roots of the cubic polynomial \( a^3 - 6a^2 + 12a - 8 \) to determine where it is positive.

### Step 5: Finding Roots

Using the Rational Root Theorem, we can test possible rational roots. Testing \( a = 2 \):

\[
2^3 - 6(2^2) + 12(2) - 8 = 8 - 24 + 24 - 8 = 0
\]

Thus, \( a = 2 \) is a root. We can factor the polynomial as follows:

\[
a^3 - 6a^2 + 12a - 8 = (a - 2)(a^2 - 4a + 4) = (a - 2)(a - 2)^2 = (a - 2)^3
\]

### Step 6: Analyze the Sign of the Polynomial

The polynomial \( (a - 2)^3 > 0 \) when \( a > 2 \). 

### Conclusion

The smallest positive real number \( a \) such that the polynomial \( P(x) \) has at least one real root is:

\[
\boxed{2}
\] 

This value ensures that \( P(-1) < 0 \) while \( P(0) = 1 > 0 \), confirming the existence of at least one real root in the interval \((-1, 0)\) by the Intermediate Value Theorem.
