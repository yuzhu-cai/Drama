To solve the expression \( x^2 + 2x(5 - x) + (5 - x)^2 \), we will follow the steps of expanding and simplifying the expression.

### Step 1: Expand Each Component

1. **Expand \( 2x(5 - x) \)**:
   \[
   2x(5 - x) = 10x - 2x^2
   \]

2. **Expand \( (5 - x)^2 \)**:
   \[
   (5 - x)^2 = 25 - 10x + x^2
   \]

### Step 2: Substitute Back into the Original Expression

Now we substitute the expanded components back into the original expression:
\[
x^2 + (10x - 2x^2) + (25 - 10x + x^2)
\]

### Step 3: Combine Like Terms

Now, we combine the like terms:

- **Combine the \( x^2 \) terms**:
  \[
  x^2 - 2x^2 + x^2 = 0
  \]

- **Combine the \( x \) terms**:
  \[
  10x - 10x = 0
  \]

- **Combine the constant terms**:
  \[
  25
  \]

### Final Result

Putting it all together, we find that the expression simplifies to:
\[
0 + 0 + 25 = 25
\]

Thus, the final simplified form of the expression \( x^2 + 2x(5 - x) + (5 - x)^2 \) is:
\[
\boxed{25}
\]

This solution shows that regardless of the value of \( x \), the expression always evaluates to 25.
