To find the range of the function 

\[
j(x) = \frac{5x + 3}{x},
\]

we will follow a systematic approach that includes identifying the domain, analyzing the behavior of the function, and evaluating limits.

### Step 1: Identify the Domain

The function \( j(x) \) is a rational function, which is defined for all real numbers except where the denominator is zero. Setting the denominator equal to zero gives:

\[
x = 0.
\]

Thus, the domain of \( j(x) \) is:

\[
(-\infty, 0) \cup (0, \infty).
\]

### Step 2: Simplify the Function

We can simplify \( j(x) \):

\[
j(x) = \frac{5x + 3}{x} = 5 + \frac{3}{x}.
\]

This form makes it easier to analyze the behavior of the function.

### Step 3: Analyze the Behavior of the Function

#### Critical Points

To find critical points, we can take the derivative of \( j(x) \):

\[
j'(x) = -\frac{3}{x^2}.
\]

The derivative \( j'(x) \) is never zero, but it is undefined at \( x = 0 \), which we already identified as a boundary of the domain.

#### Limits at the Boundaries

Next, we evaluate the limits as \( x \) approaches the boundaries of the domain:

1. **As \( x \to 0^- \)** (approaching from the left):
   \[
   j(x) = 5 + \frac{3}{x} \to 5 - \infty = -\infty.
   \]

2. **As \( x \to 0^+ \)** (approaching from the right):
   \[
   j(x) = 5 + \frac{3}{x} \to 5 + \infty = +\infty.
   \]

3. **As \( x \to \infty \)**:
   \[
   j(x) = 5 + \frac{3}{x} \to 5 + 0 = 5.
   \]

4. **As \( x \to -\infty \)**:
   \[
   j(x) = 5 + \frac{3}{x} \to 5 + 0 = 5.
   \]

### Step 4: Determine the Range

From the analysis, we see that:

- As \( x \) approaches \( 0 \) from the left, \( j(x) \) approaches \( -\infty \).
- As \( x \) approaches \( 0 \) from the right, \( j(x) \) approaches \( +\infty \).
- The function approaches \( 5 \) as \( x \) goes to both \( +\infty \) and \( -\infty \).

However, the function never actually reaches \( 5 \) because it approaches this value asymptotically. Therefore, \( j(x) \) can take all values except \( 5 \).

### Conclusion

The range of the function \( j(x) = \frac{5x + 3}{x} \) is:

\[
(-\infty, 5) \cup (5, \infty).
\]

This means that \( j(x) \) can take any real number except for \( 5 \).
