To find the sum of the roots \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) of the polynomial \(x^3 + 7x^2 - 11x - 2 = 0\), we can apply Vieta's formulas.

The polynomial is in the standard form:

\[
P(x) = x^3 + px^2 + qx + r
\]

where:
- \(p = 7\)
- \(q = -11\)
- \(r = -2\)

According to Vieta's formulas, the sum of the roots \(a + b + c\) is given by:

\[
a + b + c = -p
\]

Substituting the value of \(p\):

\[
a + b + c = -7
\]

Thus, the sum of the roots \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) for the polynomial \(x^3 + 7x^2 - 11x - 2 = 0\) is:

\[
\boxed{-7}
\] 

This solution is clear and accurately addresses the original query regarding the sum of the roots of the given polynomial.
