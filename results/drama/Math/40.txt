To solve the problem, we will follow these steps:

1. **Set up the perimeter equation** using the given expressions for length and width.
2. **Solve for \( x \)** using the perimeter equation.
3. **Calculate the length and width** using the value of \( x \).
4. **Compute the area** of the rectangle using the formula for area.

### Step 1: Set up the perimeter equation

The perimeter \( P \) of a rectangle is given by the formula:

\[
P = 2(\text{length} + \text{width})
\]

Given:
- Length \( L = 3x + 10 \) feet
- Width \( W = x + 12 \) feet

Substituting these into the perimeter formula:

\[
76 = 2((3x + 10) + (x + 12))
\]

### Step 2: Solve for \( x \)

First, simplify the equation:

\[
76 = 2(3x + 10 + x + 12)
\]
\[
76 = 2(4x + 22)
\]
\[
76 = 8x + 44
\]

Now, isolate \( x \):

\[
76 - 44 = 8x
\]
\[
32 = 8x
\]
\[
x = 4
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the length and width

Now that we have \( x = 4 \), we can find the length and width:

- Length:
\[
L = 3x + 10 = 3(4) + 10 = 12 + 10 = 22 \text{ feet}
\]

- Width:
\[
W = x + 12 = 4 + 12 = 16 \text{ feet}
\]

### Step 4: Compute the area

Now, we can calculate the area using the formula:

\[
\text{Area} = \text{length} \times \text{width}
\]
\[
\text{Area} = 22 \times 16
\]

Calculating the area:

\[
\text{Area} = 352 \text{ square feet}
\]

### Comprehensive Solution

The area of the rectangle, given that the length is \( 3x + 10 \) feet, the width is \( x + 12 \) feet, and the perimeter is 76 feet, is **352 square feet**.
