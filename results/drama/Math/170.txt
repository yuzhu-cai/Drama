To find the area of trapezoid \(BCDE\) in a regular octagon \(ABCDEFGH\) with a side length of \(12 \, \text{cm}\), we will follow these steps:

### Step 1: Calculate the Circumradius \(R\)

The circumradius \(R\) of a regular octagon can be calculated using the formula:

\[
R = \frac{s}{2 \sin(\pi/8)}
\]

where \(s\) is the side length. Given \(s = 12 \, \text{cm}\):

\[
R = \frac{12}{2 \sin(\pi/8)} = \frac{12}{2 \cdot \frac{\sqrt{2 - \sqrt{2}}}{2}} = \frac{12}{\sqrt{2 - \sqrt{2}}}
\]

To simplify \(R\):

\[
R = \frac{12 \sqrt{2 + \sqrt{2}}}{\sqrt{(2 - \sqrt{2})(2 + \sqrt{2})}} = \frac{12 \sqrt{2 + \sqrt{2}}}{\sqrt{2}} = 6 \sqrt{2 + \sqrt{2}}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the Height \(h\) of Trapezoid \(BCDE\)

The height \(h\) of trapezoid \(BCDE\) can be calculated as:

\[
h = \frac{R}{\sqrt{2}} = \frac{6 \sqrt{2 + \sqrt{2}}}{\sqrt{2}} = 3 \sqrt{2 + \sqrt{2}}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the Lengths of the Bases \(b_1\) and \(b_2\)

The lengths of the bases \(b_1\) and \(b_2\) of trapezoid \(BCDE\) are the lengths of segments \(BC\) and \(DE\).

1. **Length of base \(BC\)**:
   - Points \(B\) and \(C\) are at angles \(45^\circ\) and \(90^\circ\) respectively.
   - The coordinates of \(B\) are \(\left(6, 6\right)\) and of \(C\) are \(\left(0, 12\right)\).
   - The length of \(BC\) can be calculated using the distance formula:
   \[
   BC = \sqrt{(0 - 6)^2 + (12 - 6)^2} = \sqrt{(-6)^2 + (6)^2} = \sqrt{36 + 36} = \sqrt{72} = 6\sqrt{2}
   \]

2. **Length of base \(DE\)**:
   - Points \(D\) and \(E\) are at angles \(135^\circ\) and \(180^\circ\) respectively.
   - The coordinates of \(D\) are \(\left(-6, 6\right)\) and of \(E\) are \((-12, 0)\).
   - The length of \(DE\) can be calculated similarly:
   \[
   DE = \sqrt{(-12 + 6)^2 + (0 - 6)^2} = \sqrt{(-6)^2 + (-6)^2} = \sqrt{36 + 36} = \sqrt{72} = 6\sqrt{2}
   \]

### Step 4: Calculate the Area of Trapezoid \(BCDE\)

Now we can use the area formula for a trapezoid:

\[
\text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \times (b_1 + b_2) \times h
\]

Substituting the values we found:

- \(b_1 = 6\sqrt{2}\)
- \(b_2 = 6\sqrt{2}\)
- \(h = 3\sqrt{2 + \sqrt{2}}\)

Thus, the area becomes:

\[
\text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \times (6\sqrt{2} + 6\sqrt{2}) \times 3\sqrt{2 + \sqrt{2}} = \frac{1}{2} \times 12\sqrt{2} \times 3\sqrt{2 + \sqrt{2}}
\]

Calculating this gives:

\[
\text{Area} = 6 \times 3 \times \sqrt{2} \times \sqrt{2 + \sqrt{2}} = 18\sqrt{2(2 + \sqrt{2})}
\]

### Final Area Expression

The area of trapezoid \(BCDE\) in simplest radical form is:

\[
\text{Area} = 18\sqrt{2(2 + \sqrt{2})} \, \text{cm}^2
\]

This is the comprehensive solution to the problem.
