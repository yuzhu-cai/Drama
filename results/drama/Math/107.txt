To solve the problem, we have two key pieces of information about the three consecutive terms in an arithmetic sequence defined as \( a \), \( a + d \), and \( a + 2d \).

### Step 1: Set Up the Equations

1. **Difference between the largest and smallest terms**:
   \[
   (a + 2d) - a = 14
   \]
   Simplifying this gives:
   \[
   2d = 14 \quad \Rightarrow \quad d = 7
   \]

2. **Sum of the modified terms**:
   The modified terms are:
   - First term: \( \frac{a}{2} + a = \frac{3a}{2} \)
   - Second term: \( \frac{a}{2} + (a + d) = \frac{3a}{2} + d \)
   - Third term: \( \frac{a}{2} + (a + 2d) = \frac{3a}{2} + 2d \)

   The equation for the sum of these modified terms is:
   \[
   \frac{3a}{2} + \left(\frac{3a}{2} + d\right) + \left(\frac{3a}{2} + 2d\right) = 120
   \]
   Simplifying this gives:
   \[
   \frac{3a}{2} + \frac{3a}{2} + d + \frac{3a}{2} + 2d = 120
   \]
   Which simplifies to:
   \[
   \frac{9a}{2} + 3d = 120
   \]

### Step 2: Substitute \( d \) into the Sum Equation

Now that we have \( d = 7 \), we can substitute this value into the sum equation:
\[
\frac{9a}{2} + 3(7) = 120
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
\frac{9a}{2} + 21 = 120
\]
Subtracting 21 from both sides gives:
\[
\frac{9a}{2} = 120 - 21
\]
\[
\frac{9a}{2} = 99
\]

### Step 3: Solve for \( a \)

To isolate \( a \), multiply both sides by 2:
\[
9a = 198
\]
Now, divide by 9:
\[
a = \frac{198}{9} = 22
\]

### Conclusion

The value of the original smallest term \( a \) is:
\[
\boxed{22}
\]
