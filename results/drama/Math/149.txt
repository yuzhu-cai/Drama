To determine how many digits the decimal number \( 700 \) has when converted to base \( 5 \), we can follow a systematic approach that involves both conversion and logarithmic calculations.

### Step 1: Convert \( 700 \) to Base \( 5 \)

We previously converted the decimal number \( 700 \) to base \( 5 \) using repeated division:

1. **700 ÷ 5** = 140 with a remainder of **0**.
2. **140 ÷ 5** = 28 with a remainder of **0**.
3. **28 ÷ 5** = 5 with a remainder of **3**.
4. **5 ÷ 5** = 1 with a remainder of **0**.
5. **1 ÷ 5** = 0 with a remainder of **1**.

Reading the remainders from bottom to top, we find that the base \( 5 \) representation of \( 700 \) is \( 10300_5 \).

### Step 2: Count the Number of Digits

To find the number of digits in the base \( 5 \) representation, we can use the logarithmic formula:

\[
d = \lfloor \log_b(n) \rfloor + 1
\]

Where:
- \( n \) is the number in decimal (in this case, \( 700 \)),
- \( b \) is the base (in this case, \( 5 \)),
- \( d \) is the number of digits.

Using the change of base formula for logarithms:

\[
\log_5(700) = \frac{\log_{10}(700)}{\log_{10}(5)}
\]

Calculating the logarithms:
- \( \log_{10}(700) \approx 2.845 \)
- \( \log_{10}(5) \approx 0.699 \)

Now substituting these values:

\[
\log_5(700) \approx \frac{2.845}{0.699} \approx 4.07
\]

Applying the formula for the number of digits:

\[
d = \lfloor 4.07 \rfloor + 1 = 4 + 1 = 5
\]

### Conclusion

Thus, the number of digits in the base \( 5 \) representation of \( 700 \) is \( \boxed{5} \). This comprehensive solution confirms both the conversion and the digit count accurately.
