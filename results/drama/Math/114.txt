To solve the problem, we start with the two given equations:

1. \( x + y = 153 \)
2. \( \frac{x}{y} = 0.7 \)

### Step 1: Express \( x \) in terms of \( y \)

From the second equation, we can express \( x \) in terms of \( y \):

\[
x = 0.7y
\]

### Step 2: Substitute \( x \) into the first equation

Now, we substitute this expression for \( x \) into the first equation:

\[
0.7y + y = 153
\]

### Step 3: Combine like terms

Combining the terms on the left side gives:

\[
1.7y = 153
\]

### Step 4: Solve for \( y \)

Now, we can solve for \( y \):

\[
y = \frac{153}{1.7}
\]

Calculating this gives:

\[
y = 90
\]

### Step 5: Find \( x \)

Now that we have \( y \), we can find \( x \) using the expression we derived earlier:

\[
x = 0.7y = 0.7 \times 90 = 63
\]

### Step 6: Calculate \( y - x \)

Now we can calculate \( y - x \):

\[
y - x = 90 - 63 = 27
\]

### Conclusion

The value of \( y - x \) is:

\[
\boxed{27}
\]

This comprehensive solution addresses all aspects of the problem, providing clear steps and calculations to arrive at the final answer.
