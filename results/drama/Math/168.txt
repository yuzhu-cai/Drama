To solve the problem, we need to find the angle \( x \) in degrees that corresponds to the shaded region, which is 20% of the area of the circle.

### Step 1: Area of the Circle

The area \( A \) of a circle with radius \( r \) is given by:

\[
A = \pi r^2
\]

### Step 2: Area of the Shaded Region

The shaded region is 20% of the area of the circle. Therefore, the area of the shaded region \( A_{\text{shaded}} \) can be expressed as:

\[
A_{\text{shaded}} = 0.20 \times A = 0.20 \times \pi r^2 = \frac{1}{5} \pi r^2
\]

### Step 3: Area of the Sector

The area of the sector corresponding to the angle \( x \) (in radians) is given by:

\[
A_{\text{sector}} = \frac{x}{2\pi} \times A = \frac{x}{2\pi} \times \pi r^2 = \frac{x}{2} r^2
\]

### Step 4: Setting Up the Equation

Since the area of the shaded region is equal to the area of the sector, we can set the two expressions equal to each other:

\[
\frac{x}{2} r^2 = \frac{1}{5} \pi r^2
\]

### Step 5: Simplifying the Equation

We can cancel \( r^2 \) from both sides (assuming \( r \neq 0 \)):

\[
\frac{x}{2} = \frac{1}{5} \pi
\]

### Step 6: Solving for \( x \)

Now, multiply both sides by 2 to isolate \( x \):

\[
x = \frac{2}{5} \pi
\]

### Step 7: Converting to Degrees

To convert \( x \) from radians to degrees, we use the conversion factor \( \frac{180^\circ}{\pi} \):

\[
x = \frac{2}{5} \pi \times \frac{180^\circ}{\pi} = \frac{2 \times 180^\circ}{5} = \frac{360^\circ}{5} = 72^\circ
\]

### Conclusion

Thus, the value of the angle \( x \) corresponding to the shaded region that is 20% of the area of the circle is:

\[
\boxed{72^\circ}
\]
