To find the positive base \( b \) in which the equation \( 4 \cdot 12 = 103 \) is valid, we will follow these steps:

### Step 1: Convert the numbers to base \( b \)

1. **Convert \( 4 \)**:
   - In base \( b \), \( 4 \) remains \( 4 \) since \( 4 < b \).

2. **Convert \( 12 \)**:
   - In base \( b \), \( 12 \) can be expressed as:
     \[
     12_b = 1 \cdot b + 2
     \]

3. **Convert \( 103 \)**:
   - In base \( b \), \( 103 \) can be expressed as:
     \[
     103_b = 1 \cdot b^2 + 0 \cdot b + 3
     \]

### Step 2: Set up the equation

The original equation \( 4 \cdot 12 = 103 \) can be rewritten in terms of base \( b \):
\[
4 \cdot (1 \cdot b + 2) = 1 \cdot b^2 + 0 \cdot b + 3
\]

### Step 3: Simplify the left side

Calculating the left side:
\[
4 \cdot (b + 2) = 4b + 8
\]

### Step 4: Set the left side equal to the right side

Now we have:
\[
4b + 8 = b^2 + 3
\]

### Step 5: Rearrange the equation

Rearranging gives us:
\[
b^2 - 4b + 3 - 8 = 0
\]
\[
b^2 - 4b - 5 = 0
\]

### Step 6: Factor the quadratic equation

Factoring the quadratic:
\[
(b - 5)(b + 1) = 0
\]

### Step 7: Solve for \( b \)

The solutions to the equation are:
\[
b - 5 = 0 \quad \Rightarrow \quad b = 5
\]
\[
b + 1 = 0 \quad \Rightarrow \quad b = -1 \quad (\text{not valid since base must be positive})
\]

### Conclusion

The only valid solution for the positive base \( b \) is:
\[
\boxed{5}
\]

### Verification

To verify, we can check if the equation holds true in base \( 5 \):
- \( 4 \) in base \( 5 \) is \( 4 \).
- \( 12 \) in base \( 5 \) is \( 1 \cdot 5 + 2 = 7 \).
- \( 103 \) in base \( 5 \) is \( 1 \cdot 5^2 + 0 \cdot 5 + 3 = 25 + 0 + 3 = 28 \).

Now, check the multiplication:
\[
4 \cdot 7 = 28
\]

Since both sides are equal, the solution \( b = 5 \) is indeed correct. Thus, the comprehensive solution confirms that the positive base \( b \) in which the equation \( 4 \cdot 12 = 103 \) is valid is \( \boxed{5} \).
