To find the range of the function 

\[
p(x) = \frac{x^2 + x + 1}{x^2 + 1},
\]

we will follow a systematic approach that includes analyzing the function's behavior, finding critical points, and determining the minimum and maximum values.

### Step 1: Analyze the Function

The function \( p(x) \) is a rational function, which is defined for all real numbers since the denominator \( x^2 + 1 \) is never zero. 

### Step 2: Find the Derivative

To find the critical points, we first need to compute the derivative of \( p(x) \):

Using the quotient rule, where \( u = x^2 + x + 1 \) and \( v = x^2 + 1 \):

\[
p'(x) = \frac{u'v - uv'}{v^2}
\]

Calculating \( u' \) and \( v' \):

- \( u' = 2x + 1 \)
- \( v' = 2x \)

Now substituting into the quotient rule:

\[
p'(x) = \frac{(2x + 1)(x^2 + 1) - (x^2 + x + 1)(2x)}{(x^2 + 1)^2}
\]

Simplifying the numerator:

\[
= (2x^3 + 2x + x^2 + 1) - (2x^3 + 2x^2 + 2x) 
\]
\[
= (2x^3 + 2x + x^2 + 1 - 2x^3 - 2x^2 - 2x) 
\]
\[
= -x^2 + 1
\]

Thus, the derivative is:

\[
p'(x) = \frac{-x^2 + 1}{(x^2 + 1)^2}
\]

### Step 3: Set the Derivative to Zero

Setting the numerator equal to zero to find critical points:

\[
-x^2 + 1 = 0 \implies x^2 = 1 \implies x = 1 \text{ or } x = -1
\]

### Step 4: Evaluate the Function at Critical Points

Now we evaluate \( p(x) \) at the critical points \( x = 1 \) and \( x = -1 \):

- For \( x = 1 \):
\[
p(1) = \frac{1^2 + 1 + 1}{1^2 + 1} = \frac{3}{2} = 1.5
\]

- For \( x = -1 \):
\[
p(-1) = \frac{(-1)^2 + (-1) + 1}{(-1)^2 + 1} = \frac{1 - 1 + 1}{1 + 1} = \frac{1}{2} = 0.5
\]

### Step 5: Analyze Behavior as \( x \to \pm \infty \)

Next, we analyze the limits as \( x \) approaches positive and negative infinity:

\[
\lim_{x \to \pm \infty} p(x) = \lim_{x \to \pm \infty} \frac{x^2 + x + 1}{x^2 + 1} = \lim_{x \to \pm \infty} \frac{1 + \frac{1}{x} + \frac{1}{x^2}}{1 + \frac{1}{x^2}} = 1
\]

### Step 6: Determine the Range

From our evaluations:

- The critical points yield \( p(1) = 1.5 \) (local maximum) and \( p(-1) = 0.5 \) (local minimum).
- As \( x \to \pm \infty \), \( p(x) \) approaches 1.

Thus, the function achieves a maximum value of \( 1.5 \) and a minimum value of \( 0.5 \). The function is continuous, and since it approaches 1 as \( x \) goes to infinity, we can conclude that the range of \( p(x) \) is:

\[
\text{Range of } p(x) = \left[0.5, 1.5\right]
\]

### Final Answer

The range of the function 

\[
p(x) = \frac{x^2 + x + 1}{x^2 + 1}
\]

is 

\[
\boxed{[0.5, 1.5]}.
\]
