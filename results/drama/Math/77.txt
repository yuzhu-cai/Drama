To find the sum of the quotient and remainder when dividing the polynomial \( 6x^3 + 9x^2 - 17x + 11 \) by \( 2x^2 + 5x - 1 \), we first need to perform the polynomial long division, which we have already done in a previous step.

### Step 1: Polynomial Long Division

1. **Divide the leading terms**:
   - Divide \( 6x^3 \) by \( 2x^2 \) to get \( 3x \).

2. **Multiply and subtract**:
   - Multiply \( 3x \) by \( 2x^2 + 5x - 1 \):
     \[
     3x(2x^2 + 5x - 1) = 6x^3 + 15x^2 - 3x
     \]
   - Subtract this from the original polynomial:
     \[
     (6x^3 + 9x^2 - 17x + 11) - (6x^3 + 15x^2 - 3x) = -6x^2 - 14x + 11
     \]

3. **Repeat the process**:
   - Divide \( -6x^2 \) by \( 2x^2 \) to get \( -3 \).
   - Multiply \( -3 \) by \( 2x^2 + 5x - 1 \):
     \[
     -3(2x^2 + 5x - 1) = -6x^2 - 15x + 3
     \]
   - Subtract this from the current polynomial:
     \[
     (-6x^2 - 14x + 11) - (-6x^2 - 15x + 3) = x + 8
     \]

### Step 2: Identify the Quotient and Remainder

From the division, we have:
- **Quotient**: \( 3x - 3 \)
- **Remainder**: \( x + 8 \)

### Step 3: Calculate the Sum of the Quotient and Remainder

Now, we need to find the sum of the quotient and the remainder:
\[
\text{Sum} = (3x - 3) + (x + 8)
\]

Combining like terms:
\[
\text{Sum} = 3x - 3 + x + 8 = 4x + 5
\]

### Final Result

Thus, the sum of the quotient and the remainder when dividing \( 6x^3 + 9x^2 - 17x + 11 \) by \( 2x^2 + 5x - 1 \) is:
\[
\boxed{4x + 5}
\]
