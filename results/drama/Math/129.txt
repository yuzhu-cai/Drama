To solve the original query, we need to evaluate the expression \( a * b = a^b + b^a \) for the specific values \( a = 2 \) and \( b = 6 \). We will follow these steps to arrive at a comprehensive solution:

### Step 1: Substitute the Values

We substitute \( a = 2 \) and \( b = 6 \) into the equation:

\[
2 * 6 = 2^6 + 6^2
\]

### Step 2: Calculate \( 2^6 \)

From our previous calculations, we found:

\[
2^6 = 64
\]

### Step 3: Calculate \( 6^2 \)

Similarly, we calculated:

\[
6^2 = 36
\]

### Step 4: Add the Results

Now, we add the results of \( 2^6 \) and \( 6^2 \):

\[
2^6 + 6^2 = 64 + 36 = 100
\]

### Step 5: Conclusion

Thus, substituting \( a = 2 \) and \( b = 6 \) into the equation \( a * b = a^b + b^a \) gives us:

\[
2 * 6 = 100
\]

Therefore, the value of \( 2 * 6 \) is 

\[
\boxed{100}
\] 

This solution clearly outlines the steps taken to arrive at the final answer, ensuring that all aspects of the problem are addressed accurately.
