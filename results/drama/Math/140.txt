To solve the problem regarding the number of quarters Wendy has, we need to address the following conditions:

1. When stacked in piles of 5, she has 3 left over:
   \[
   x \equiv 3 \mod{5}
   \]
   
2. When stacked in piles of 7, she has 5 left over:
   \[
   x \equiv 5 \mod{7}
   \]

3. The total value of the quarters must be less than 10 dollars, which translates to:
   \[
   x < 40 \quad (\text{since } 10 \text{ dollars } = 40 \text{ quarters})
   \]

### Step 1: Set Up the Congruences

From the congruences, we can express \( x \) in terms of integers \( k \) and \( m \):

1. From \( x \equiv 3 \mod{5} \):
   \[
   x = 5k + 3 \quad \text{for some integer } k
   \]

2. From \( x \equiv 5 \mod{7} \):
   \[
   x = 7m + 5 \quad \text{for some integer } m
   \]

### Step 2: Solve the Congruences

We can set the two expressions for \( x \) equal to each other:
\[
5k + 3 = 7m + 5
\]

Rearranging gives:
\[
5k - 7m = 2
\]

### Step 3: Find Integer Solutions

To find integer solutions for \( k \) and \( m \), we can express \( k \) in terms of \( m \):
\[
5k = 7m + 2 \implies k = \frac{7m + 2}{5}
\]

For \( k \) to be an integer, \( 7m + 2 \) must be divisible by 5. We can check values of \( m \) to find suitable integers:

- For \( m = 0 \):
  \[
  7(0) + 2 = 2 \quad \text{(not divisible by 5)}
  \]
  
- For \( m = 1 \):
  \[
  7(1) + 2 = 9 \quad \text{(not divisible by 5)}
  \]

- For \( m = 2 \):
  \[
  7(2) + 2 = 16 \quad \text{(not divisible by 5)}
  \]

- For \( m = 3 \):
  \[
  7(3) + 2 = 23 \quad \text{(not divisible by 5)}
  \]

- For \( m = 4 \):
  \[
  7(4) + 2 = 30 \quad \text{(divisible by 5, } k = 6)
  \]

- For \( m = 5 \):
  \[
  7(5) + 2 = 37 \quad \text{(not divisible by 5)}
  \]

### Step 4: Calculate \( x \)

Using \( m = 4 \) and \( k = 6 \):
\[
x = 7(4) + 5 = 28 + 5 = 33
\]
or
\[
x = 5(6) + 3 = 30 + 3 = 33
\]

### Step 5: Verify Conditions

1. **Check \( x < 40 \)**:
   \[
   33 < 40 \quad \text{(satisfied)}
   \]

2. **Check \( x \equiv 3 \mod{5} \)**:
   \[
   33 \mod{5} = 3 \quad \text{(satisfied)}
   \]

3. **Check \( x \equiv 5 \mod{7} \)**:
   \[
   33 \mod{7} = 5 \quad \text{(satisfied)}
   \]

### Conclusion

Wendy has **33 quarters**. This number satisfies all the conditions of the problem: it is less than 10 dollars, leaves a remainder of 3 when divided by 5, and a remainder of 5 when divided by 7.
