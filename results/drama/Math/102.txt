To find the value of \( x \) for which 

\[
\sqrt{x + \sqrt{x + \sqrt{x + \ldots}}} = 5,
\]

we can follow these steps:

1. **Set up the equation**: We denote the infinite nested square root as \( y \), so we have:

   \[
   y = \sqrt{x + y}.
   \]

   Given that \( y = 5 \), we can substitute this into the equation:

   \[
   5 = \sqrt{x + 5}.
   \]

2. **Square both sides**: To eliminate the square root, we square both sides:

   \[
   5^2 = (\sqrt{x + 5})^2.
   \]

   This simplifies to:

   \[
   25 = x + 5.
   \]

3. **Isolate \( x \)**: Next, we isolate \( x \) by subtracting 5 from both sides:

   \[
   25 - 5 = x,
   \]

   which simplifies to:

   \[
   x = 20.
   \]

4. **Final result**: Thus, the value of \( x \) for which 

   \[
   \sqrt{x + \sqrt{x + \sqrt{x + \ldots}}} = 5
   \]

   is 

   \[
   \boxed{20}.
   \]

This solution is clear and addresses all aspects of the problem, confirming that \( x = 20 \) satisfies the original equation.
