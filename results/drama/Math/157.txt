To solve the problem of determining the greatest possible value of the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two consecutive Fibonacci numbers, we start by recalling the definition of the Fibonacci sequence:

- \( F_0 = 0 \)
- \( F_1 = 1 \)
- For \( n \geq 2 \), \( F_n = F_{n-1} + F_{n-2} \)

### Step 1: Calculate the GCD of Consecutive Fibonacci Numbers

We want to find \( \gcd(F_n, F_{n+1}) \) for \( n \geq 0 \). A key property of Fibonacci numbers is that:

\[
\gcd(F_n, F_{n+1}) = \gcd(F_n, F_{n+1} - F_n) = \gcd(F_n, F_{n-2})
\]

This property allows us to reduce the GCD calculation repeatedly until we reach the base cases of the Fibonacci sequence.

### Step 2: Reduce the GCD Calculation

Using the property mentioned, we can continue reducing:

\[
\gcd(F_n, F_{n+1}) = \gcd(F_n, F_{n-2}) = \gcd(F_{n-2}, F_{n-3}) = \ldots
\]

Eventually, this process will lead us to:

\[
\gcd(F_n, F_{n+1}) = \gcd(F_1, F_0)
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the GCD of Base Cases

From the Fibonacci sequence, we know:

- \( F_0 = 0 \)
- \( F_1 = 1 \)

Thus, we have:

\[
\gcd(F_0, F_1) = \gcd(0, 1) = 1
\]

### Step 4: General Conclusion

Since the GCD of any two consecutive Fibonacci numbers reduces to the GCD of \( F_0 \) and \( F_1 \), we conclude that:

\[
\gcd(F_n, F_{n+1}) = 1 \quad \text{for all } n \geq 0
\]

### Final Answer

Therefore, the greatest possible value of the greatest common divisor of two consecutive Fibonacci numbers is:

\[
\boxed{1}
\] 

This result indicates that consecutive Fibonacci numbers are coprime, meaning they share no common divisors other than 1.
