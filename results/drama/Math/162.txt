To solve the problem, we start by defining the variables and setting up the equations based on the given ratio \(3:14:4\).

1. **Define the angles**:
   - Let the measure of angle \( A \) be \( x \) degrees.
   - The complement of angle \( A \) is \( 90^\circ - x \).
   - The supplement of angle \( A \) is \( 180^\circ - x \).

2. **Set up the ratio**:
   According to the problem, the ratio of three times the measure of angle \( A \) to four times the measure of the complement of angle \( A \) to half the measure of the supplement of angle \( A \) is \( 3:14:4 \). This can be expressed as:

   \[
   \frac{3x}{4(90^\circ - x)} = \frac{3}{14} \quad \text{and} \quad \frac{3x}{\frac{1}{2}(180^\circ - x)} = \frac{3}{4}
   \]

3. **Set up the equations**:
   From the first part of the ratio:

   \[
   \frac{3x}{4(90^\circ - x)} = \frac{3}{14}
   \]

   Cross-multiplying gives:

   \[
   3x \cdot 14 = 4(90^\circ - x) \cdot 3
   \]

   Simplifying this:

   \[
   42x = 12(90^\circ - x)
   \]

   Expanding the right side:

   \[
   42x = 1080^\circ - 12x
   \]

   Combining like terms:

   \[
   42x + 12x = 1080^\circ
   \]

   \[
   54x = 1080^\circ
   \]

   Solving for \( x \):

   \[
   x = \frac{1080^\circ}{54} = 20^\circ
   \]

4. **Calculate the complement of angle \( A \)**:
   Now that we have \( x = 20^\circ \), we can find the complement of angle \( A \):

   \[
   \text{Complement of } A = 90^\circ - x = 90^\circ - 20^\circ = 70^\circ
   \]

5. **Final answer**:
   Therefore, the measure of the complement of angle \( A \) is:

   \[
   \boxed{70^\circ}
   \] 

This comprehensive solution addresses all aspects of the problem, providing clear steps and calculations leading to the final answer.
