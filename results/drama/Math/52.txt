To determine the maximum possible number of handshakes among 22 people at a party, where each person can shake hands with at most 20 others, we can follow a systematic approach.

### Step 1: Understanding the Constraints

1. **Total People**: There are 22 people at the party.
2. **Handshake Limitation**: Each person can shake hands with at most 20 others. This means that each person cannot shake hands with one person (since there are 21 other people).

### Step 2: Maximum Handshakes Calculation

To find the maximum number of unique handshakes, we can use the combination formula, which calculates the number of ways to choose 2 people from a group of \( n \):

\[
C(n, 2) = \frac{n(n - 1)}{2}
\]

However, since each person can only shake hands with 20 others, we need to adjust our calculation to reflect this limitation.

### Step 3: Adjusting for the Limitation

Given that each of the 22 people can only shake hands with 20 others, we can think of the scenario as follows:

- Each person shakes hands with 20 others, leading to a potential handshake count of:
  \[
  \text{Total handshakes} = \frac{22 \times 20}{2}
  \]
  This formula accounts for the fact that each handshake involves two people, hence we divide by 2.

### Step 4: Performing the Calculation

Now, substituting the values into the formula:

\[
\text{Total handshakes} = \frac{22 \times 20}{2} = \frac{440}{2} = 220
\]

### Step 5: Conclusion

Thus, the maximum possible number of unique handshakes among 22 people at the party, where each person can shake hands with at most 20 others, is:

\[
\boxed{220}
\]

This solution comprehensively addresses the problem by considering both the total number of people and the limitation on handshakes, ensuring that no handshake is counted more than once.
