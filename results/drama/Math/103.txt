To simplify the expression \((7b^3)^2 \cdot (4b^2)^{-3}\), we will use the results from the previous subtasks and combine them step by step.

### Step 1: Simplify \((7b^3)^2\)

From our previous work, we found that:
\[
(7b^3)^2 = 49b^6
\]

### Step 2: Simplify \((4b^2)^{-3}\)

We also found that:
\[
(4b^2)^{-3} = \frac{1}{64b^6}
\]

### Step 3: Combine the Results

Now we need to multiply the results from Step 1 and Step 2 together:
\[
(7b^3)^2 \cdot (4b^2)^{-3} = 49b^6 \cdot \frac{1}{64b^6}
\]

### Step 4: Perform the Multiplication

When we multiply these two expressions, we can combine the coefficients and the variable parts:
\[
49b^6 \cdot \frac{1}{64b^6} = \frac{49}{64} \cdot \frac{b^6}{b^6}
\]

Since \(b^6/b^6 = 1\) (as long as \(b\) is non-zero), we have:
\[
\frac{49}{64} \cdot 1 = \frac{49}{64}
\]

### Final Result

Thus, the simplified expression for \((7b^3)^2 \cdot (4b^2)^{-3}\) is:
\[
\boxed{\frac{49}{64}}
\] 

This solution is clear and accurate, addressing all aspects of the problem while ensuring that \(b\) is non-zero throughout the calculations.
