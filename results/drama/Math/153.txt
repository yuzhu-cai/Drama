To find the one hundredth positive integer that can be expressed using only the digits 0 and 1 in base 3, we can follow these steps:

### Step 1: Understanding the Representation

In base 3, numbers can be represented using the digits 0, 1, and 2. However, we are specifically interested in numbers that can be represented using only the digits 0 and 1. This means we are looking for numbers that can be expressed as sums of distinct powers of 3.

### Step 2: Identifying the Pattern

The integers that can be represented using only the digits 0 and 1 in base 3 correspond to the binary representation of integers. For example:
- The binary number \(1\) corresponds to \(3^0 = 1\).
- The binary number \(10\) corresponds to \(3^1 = 3\).
- The binary number \(11\) corresponds to \(3^0 + 3^1 = 4\).
- The binary number \(100\) corresponds to \(3^2 = 9\).
- The binary number \(101\) corresponds to \(3^0 + 3^2 = 10\).

### Step 3: Generating the First 100 Integers

To find the one hundredth integer, we can generate the integers by counting in binary and interpreting each binary number as a sum of distinct powers of 3. The first 100 integers in binary (from \(1\) to \(100\)) will correspond to the integers we are interested in.

### Step 4: Finding the One Hundredth Integer

The one hundredth positive integer in binary is \(1100100_2\). We need to convert this binary number to its corresponding sum of powers of 3.

1. Convert \(1100100_2\) to decimal:
   - \(1 \cdot 2^6 + 1 \cdot 2^5 + 0 \cdot 2^4 + 0 \cdot 2^3 + 1 \cdot 2^2 + 0 \cdot 2^1 + 0 \cdot 2^0\)
   - This equals \(64 + 32 + 0 + 0 + 4 + 0 + 0 = 100\).

2. Now, interpret \(100\) in binary as a sum of powers of 3:
   - The binary representation \(1100100_2\) corresponds to:
     - \(1 \cdot 3^6 + 1 \cdot 3^5 + 0 \cdot 3^4 + 0 \cdot 3^3 + 1 \cdot 3^2 + 0 \cdot 3^1 + 0 \cdot 3^0\)
   - This equals \(729 + 243 + 0 + 0 + 9 + 0 + 0 = 981\).

### Conclusion

Thus, the one hundredth positive integer that can be expressed using only the digits 0 and 1 in base 3, when converted to base 10, is:

\[
\boxed{981}
\]
