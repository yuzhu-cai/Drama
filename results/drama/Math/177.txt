To find the probability that Morgan randomly selects a shirt that is not a baseball shirt, we will follow these steps:

### Step 1: Determine the Total Number of Shirts
Morgan has the following shirts:
- Hockey shirts: 3
- Football shirts: 2
- Baseball shirts: 7

Now, we can calculate the total number of shirts \( T \):
\[
T = \text{Hockey shirts} + \text{Football shirts} + \text{Baseball shirts} = 3 + 2 + 7 = 12
\]

### Step 2: Determine the Number of Non-Baseball Shirts
Next, we calculate the number of shirts that are not baseball shirts. This includes the hockey and football shirts:
\[
\text{Number of non-baseball shirts} = \text{Hockey shirts} + \text{Football shirts} = 3 + 2 = 5
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the Probability
Now, we can calculate the probability \( P \) of selecting a shirt that is not a baseball shirt:
\[
P(\text{not a baseball shirt}) = \frac{\text{Number of non-baseball shirts}}{\text{Total number of shirts}} = \frac{5}{12}
\]

### Conclusion
The probability that Morgan randomly selects a shirt that is not a baseball shirt is:
\[
\boxed{\frac{5}{12}}
\]

This fraction is already in its simplest form, and thus, the solution is clear, accurate, and addresses all aspects of the problem.
