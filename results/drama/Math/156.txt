To provide a comprehensive solution to the original query, we will synthesize the results from the previous analysis regarding the assignment of integers to the faces of a cube, the calculation of vertex sums, and the determination of the largest number that must divide the final sum.

### Step 1: Assigning Integers to the Faces of the Cube

Let the integers assigned to the six faces of the cube be denoted as:
- \( F_1 = a_1 \)
- \( F_2 = a_2 \)
- \( F_3 = a_3 \)
- \( F_4 = a_4 \)
- \( F_5 = a_5 \)
- \( F_6 = a_6 \)

### Step 2: Calculating the Sum at Each Vertex

Each vertex of the cube is formed by the intersection of three faces. The cube has 8 vertices, and the sums at each vertex can be calculated as follows:

1. **Vertex 1**: \( a_1 + a_2 + a_3 \)
2. **Vertex 2**: \( a_1 + a_2 + a_4 \)
3. **Vertex 3**: \( a_1 + a_5 + a_3 \)
4. **Vertex 4**: \( a_1 + a_5 + a_4 \)
5. **Vertex 5**: \( a_6 + a_2 + a_3 \)
6. **Vertex 6**: \( a_6 + a_2 + a_4 \)
7. **Vertex 7**: \( a_6 + a_5 + a_3 \)
8. **Vertex 8**: \( a_6 + a_5 + a_4 \)

### Step 3: Summing the Values at All Vertices

The total sum of the values at all vertices is:

\[
\text{Total Sum} = (a_1 + a_2 + a_3) + (a_1 + a_2 + a_4) + (a_1 + a_5 + a_3) + (a_1 + a_5 + a_4) + (a_6 + a_2 + a_3) + (a_6 + a_2 + a_4) + (a_6 + a_5 + a_3) + (a_6 + a_5 + a_4)
\]

### Step 4: Grouping the Terms

Grouping the terms by face, we find:

- \( a_1 \) appears in 4 vertices: \( 4a_1 \)
- \( a_2 \) appears in 4 vertices: \( 4a_2 \)
- \( a_3 \) appears in 4 vertices: \( 4a_3 \)
- \( a_4 \) appears in 4 vertices: \( 4a_4 \)
- \( a_5 \) appears in 4 vertices: \( 4a_5 \)
- \( a_6 \) appears in 4 vertices: \( 4a_6 \)

Thus, the total sum can be expressed as:

\[
\text{Total Sum} = 4(a_1 + a_2 + a_3 + a_4 + a_5 + a_6)
\]

### Step 5: Determining the Largest Divisor

Now, we need to find the largest number that must divide this total sum for every possible assignment of integers to the faces. 

Since the total sum is \( 4 \times S \), where \( S = a_1 + a_2 + a_3 + a_4 + a_5 + a_6 \), we can analyze the divisibility:

1. **Divisibility by 4**: The factor of 4 ensures that the total sum is always divisible by 4.
2. **Divisibility by 1**: Every integer is divisible by 1.

However, since \( S \) can take on any integer value depending on the specific assignments of \( a_1, a_2, a_3, a_4, a_5, \) and \( a_6 \), we cannot guarantee that \( S \) is divisible by any number greater than 1 or 4.

### Conclusion

The largest number that must divide the final sum for every possible assignment of integers to the faces of the cube is:

\[
\boxed{4}
\] 

This conclusion is based on the fact that the total sum is always a multiple of 4, regardless of the specific integers assigned to the faces.
