To find Tamara's score on the misplaced quiz, we can follow these steps based on the information provided:

### Step 1: Calculate the Total Score

Tamara knows that the arithmetic mean of her five quiz scores is 95%. The formula for the total score based on the mean is:

\[
\text{Total Score} = \text{Mean} \times \text{Number of Quizzes}
\]

Given:
- Mean \( M = 95\% \)
- Number of Quizzes \( N = 5 \)

Substituting these values into the formula:

\[
\text{Total Score} = 95\% \times 5 = 475\%
\]

### Step 2: Sum the Known Scores

Next, we need to sum the scores of the quizzes that Tamara has:

- Known Scores: 100%, 100%, 99%, and 98%

Calculating the sum:

\[
\text{Sum of Known Scores} = 100\% + 100\% + 99\% + 98\% = 397\%
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the Score of the Misplaced Quiz

Now, we can find the score of the misplaced quiz by subtracting the sum of the known scores from the total score:

\[
\text{Score of Misplaced Quiz} = \text{Total Score} - \text{Sum of Known Scores}
\]

Substituting the values we calculated:

\[
\text{Score of Misplaced Quiz} = 475\% - 397\% = 78\%
\]

### Conclusion

Tamara's score on the misplaced quiz is:

\[
\boxed{78\%}
\]

This solution clearly outlines the steps taken to arrive at the final answer, ensuring that all aspects of the problem are addressed accurately.
