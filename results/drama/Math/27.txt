To find the total number of students in the Math Club (\( M \)), we can use the information provided in the problem and the equations we derived earlier.

### Given Information:
1. **Total students in the Science Club**: 15
2. **30% of students in the Math Club are in the Science Club**: This can be expressed as:
   \[
   \text{Number of students in Science Club} = 0.30M
   \]
3. **80% of students in the Science Club are in the Math Club**: This can be expressed as:
   \[
   \text{Number of students in Math Club who are also in Science Club} = 0.80 \times 15 = 12
   \]

### Setting Up the Equations:
From the first piece of information, we can set up the equation:
\[
0.30M = 12
\]

### Solving for \( M \):
To find \( M \), we can rearrange the equation:
\[
M = \frac{12}{0.30}
\]

Calculating this gives:
\[
M = \frac{12}{0.30} = 40
\]

### Conclusion:
The total number of students in the Math Club is \( \boxed{40} \).

### Verification:
1. **Calculating 30% of \( M \)**:
   \[
   0.30 \times 40 = 12
   \]
   This matches the number of students in the Science Club who are also in the Math Club.

2. **Calculating 80% of the Science Club**:
   \[
   0.80 \times 15 = 12
   \]
   This confirms that 12 students in the Science Club are also in the Math Club.

Both calculations are consistent with the information provided, confirming that our solution is accurate. Thus, the total number of students in the Math Club is indeed \( \boxed{40} \).
