To find the 500,000th number in the sequence defined by the rules provided, we need to analyze the pattern of listing and skipping numbers in detail.

### Sequence Construction Rules:
1. **Iteration 1**: List 4 numbers (1, 2, 3, 4), skip 1 number (5).
2. **Iteration 2**: List 5 numbers (6, 7, 8, 9, 10), skip 2 numbers (11, 12).
3. **Iteration 3**: List 6 numbers (13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18), skip 3 numbers (19, 20, 21).
4. **Iteration 4**: List 7 numbers (22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28), skip 4 numbers (29, 30, 31, 32).
5. **Iteration 5**: List 8 numbers (33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40), skip 5 numbers (41, 42, 43, 44, 45).
6. **Iteration n**: List \( n + 3 \) numbers and skip \( n \) numbers.

### General Pattern:
- In the \( n \)-th iteration, the number of integers listed is \( n + 3 \).
- The number of integers skipped is \( n \).
- The total count of numbers processed in the \( n \)-th iteration is \( (n + 3) + n = 2n + 3 \).

### Cumulative Count:
To find the total number of integers processed after \( n \) iterations, we can sum the total counts for each iteration:

\[
\text{Total numbers processed after } n \text{ iterations} = \sum_{k=1}^{n} (2k + 3)
\]

This can be simplified as follows:

\[
= \sum_{k=1}^{n} 2k + \sum_{k=1}^{n} 3
\]
\[
= 2 \cdot \frac{n(n + 1)}{2} + 3n
\]
\[
= n(n + 1) + 3n
\]
\[
= n^2 + 4n
\]

### Finding \( n \) for the 500,000th Number:
We need to find \( n \) such that:

\[
n^2 + 4n \leq 500,000
\]

This is a quadratic inequality. Rearranging gives:

\[
n^2 + 4n - 500,000 \leq 0
\]

Using the quadratic formula \( n = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \):

Here, \( a = 1, b = 4, c = -500,000 \):

\[
n = \frac{-4 \pm \sqrt{4^2 - 4 \cdot 1 \cdot (-500,000)}}{2 \cdot 1}
\]
\[
= \frac{-4 \pm \sqrt{16 + 2,000,000}}{2}
\]
\[
= \frac{-4 \pm \sqrt{2,000,016}}{2}
\]
\[
\approx \frac{-4 \pm 1414.21}{2}
\]

Taking the positive root:

\[
n \approx \frac{1410.21}{2} \approx 705.105
\]

Since \( n \) must be an integer, we check \( n = 705 \) and \( n = 706 \).

1. **For \( n = 705 \)**:
   \[
   705^2 + 4 \cdot 705 = 497025 + 2820 = 499845
   \]

2. **For \( n = 706 \)**:
   \[
   706^2 + 4 \cdot 706 = 498436 + 2824 = 501260
   \]

Thus, the 500,000th number falls between the totals for \( n = 705 \) and \( n = 706 \).

### Finding the Exact Position:
- Total numbers processed after 705 iterations: **499,845**
- Total numbers processed after 706 iterations: **501,260**

The 500,000th number is the \( 500,000 - 499,845 = 155 \)-th number in the 706th iteration.

### Listing in the 706th Iteration:
- In the 706th iteration, we list \( 706 + 3 = 709 \) numbers and skip \( 706 \) numbers.
- The numbers listed in this iteration start from the last number processed in the 705th iteration.

To find the last number processed in the 705th iteration, we calculate:

\[
\text{Last number in 705th iteration} = 499845 + 706 + 3 = 500554
\]

The numbers listed in the 706th iteration are:

- Start from 500,555 and list 709 numbers: 
  - The first number is 500,555, and the last number is \( 500,555 + 709 - 1 = 501,263 \).

### Conclusion:
The 155th number in the 706th iteration is:

\[
500,555 + 154 = 500,709
\]

Thus, the **500,000th number in the sequence is**:

\[
\boxed{500709}
\]
