Let's break down the solution step-by-step based on the original query:

### Step 1: Identify the Four Consecutive Integers
We start with the equation for the sum of four consecutive integers equal to 22. We defined the first integer as \( n \), leading to the following integers:

- First integer: \( n \)
- Second integer: \( n + 1 \)
- Third integer: \( n + 2 \)
- Fourth integer: \( n + 3 \)

Setting up the equation for their sum:

\[
n + (n + 1) + (n + 2) + (n + 3) = 22
\]

Simplifying this gives:

\[
4n + 6 = 22
\]

Solving for \( n \):

1. Subtract 6 from both sides:
   \[
   4n = 16
   \]
2. Divide by 4:
   \[
   n = 4
   \]

Thus, the four consecutive integers are:
- \( 4 \)
- \( 5 \)
- \( 6 \)
- \( 7 \)

### Step 2: Increase Each Integer by 2
Next, we increase each of these integers by 2:

- First integer: \( 4 + 2 = 6 \)
- Second integer: \( 5 + 2 = 7 \)
- Third integer: \( 6 + 2 = 8 \)
- Fourth integer: \( 7 + 2 = 9 \)

The new set of integers is:
- \( 6 \)
- \( 7 \)
- \( 8 \)
- \( 9 \)

### Step 3: Multiply Each New Integer by 20
Now, we multiply each of the new integers by 20:

- First integer: \( 6 \times 20 = 120 \)
- Second integer: \( 7 \times 20 = 140 \)
- Third integer: \( 8 \times 20 = 160 \)
- Fourth integer: \( 9 \times 20 = 180 \)

The new set of integers after multiplication is:
- \( 120 \)
- \( 140 \)
- \( 160 \)
- \( 180 \)

### Step 4: Calculate the Sum of the New Set of Integers
Finally, we calculate the sum of the new set of integers:

\[
120 + 140 + 160 + 180
\]

Calculating this step-by-step:

1. \( 120 + 140 = 260 \)
2. \( 260 + 160 = 420 \)
3. \( 420 + 180 = 600 \)

### Final Result
The sum of the new set of integers is **600**.

Thus, the comprehensive solution to the original query is that the sum of the new set of integers, after increasing each of the original four consecutive integers by 2 and then multiplying by 20, is **600**.
