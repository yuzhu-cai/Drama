To determine the positive value of \( n \) for which the quadratic equation \( 9x^2 + nx + 36 = 0 \) has exactly one solution, we need to analyze the discriminant of the equation.

### Step 1: Identify the coefficients
The quadratic equation is in the form \( ax^2 + bx + c = 0 \), where:
- \( a = 9 \)
- \( b = n \)
- \( c = 36 \)

### Step 2: Calculate the discriminant
The discriminant \( D \) is given by the formula:

\[
D = b^2 - 4ac
\]

Substituting the values of \( a \), \( b \), and \( c \):

\[
D = n^2 - 4 \cdot 9 \cdot 36
\]

### Step 3: Simplify the discriminant
Calculating \( 4 \cdot 9 \cdot 36 \):

\[
4 \cdot 9 = 36
\]
\[
36 \cdot 36 = 1296
\]

Thus, the discriminant becomes:

\[
D = n^2 - 1296
\]

### Step 4: Set the discriminant equal to zero
For the quadratic equation to have exactly one solution, we set the discriminant equal to zero:

\[
n^2 - 1296 = 0
\]

### Step 5: Solve for \( n \)
Rearranging the equation gives:

\[
n^2 = 1296
\]

Taking the square root of both sides results in:

\[
n = \pm \sqrt{1296}
\]

Calculating \( \sqrt{1296} \):

\[
\sqrt{1296} = 36
\]

Thus, we have two possible values for \( n \):

\[
n = 36 \quad \text{or} \quad n = -36
\]

### Step 6: Identify the positive value
Since the problem specifically asks for the positive value of \( n \), we conclude that:

\[
\text{The positive value of } n \text{ is } 36.
\]

### Final Answer
The positive value of \( n \) for which the equation \( 9x^2 + nx + 36 = 0 \) has exactly one solution is:

\[
\boxed{36}
\]
