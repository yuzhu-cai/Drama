To determine the type of curve defined by the equation 

\[
r^2 \cos 2\theta = 4,
\]

we first converted the polar equation into Cartesian coordinates. 

### Step 1: Conversion to Cartesian Coordinates

Using the relationships between polar and Cartesian coordinates:

1. \( r^2 = x^2 + y^2 \)
2. \( \cos 2\theta = \frac{x^2 - y^2}{r^2} \)

We substitute these into the original equation:

\[
r^2 \cos 2\theta = 4 \implies r^2 \left( \frac{x^2 - y^2}{r^2} \right) = 4.
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
x^2 - y^2 = 4.
\]

### Step 2: Identify the Type of Curve

The equation \( x^2 - y^2 = 4 \) can be recognized as the standard form of a hyperbola. Specifically, it can be rewritten as:

\[
\frac{x^2}{4} - \frac{y^2}{4} = 1,
\]

which matches the standard form of a hyperbola:

\[
\frac{(x - h)^2}{a^2} - \frac{(y - k)^2}{b^2} = 1.
\]

### Conclusion

Based on the analysis, the equation \( r^2 \cos 2\theta = 4 \) represents a hyperbola.

### Final Answer

The correct option is:

**(E) Hyperbola**
