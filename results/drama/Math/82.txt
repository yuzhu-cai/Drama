To compute the product of all the roots of the equation 

\[
\sqrt{5 | x | + 8} = \sqrt{x^2 - 16},
\]

we first need to solve the equation and identify the roots.

### Step 1: Square Both Sides

We start by squaring both sides to eliminate the square roots:

\[
(\sqrt{5 | x | + 8})^2 = (\sqrt{x^2 - 16})^2.
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
5 | x | + 8 = x^2 - 16.
\]

### Step 2: Rearrange the Equation

Rearranging gives us:

\[
x^2 - 5 | x | - 24 = 0.
\]

### Step 3: Consider Cases for \(|x|\)

We will consider two cases based on the definition of absolute value.

#### Case 1: \(x \geq 0\)

In this case, \(|x| = x\). The equation becomes:

\[
x^2 - 5x - 24 = 0.
\]

Using the quadratic formula:

\[
x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} = \frac{5 \pm \sqrt{(-5)^2 - 4 \cdot 1 \cdot (-24)}}{2 \cdot 1} = \frac{5 \pm \sqrt{25 + 96}}{2} = \frac{5 \pm \sqrt{121}}{2}.
\]

Calculating the roots:

\[
x = \frac{5 + 11}{2} = 8 \quad \text{and} \quad x = \frac{5 - 11}{2} = -3 \quad (\text{not valid since } x \geq 0).
\]

Thus, from this case, we have \(x = 8\).

#### Case 2: \(x < 0\)

In this case, \(|x| = -x\). The equation becomes:

\[
x^2 + 5x - 24 = 0.
\]

Using the quadratic formula again:

\[
x = \frac{-5 \pm \sqrt{5^2 - 4 \cdot 1 \cdot (-24)}}{2 \cdot 1} = \frac{-5 \pm \sqrt{25 + 96}}{2} = \frac{-5 \pm \sqrt{121}}{2}.
\]

Calculating the roots:

\[
x = \frac{-5 + 11}{2} = 3 \quad (\text{not valid since } x < 0) \quad \text{and} \quad x = \frac{-5 - 11}{2} = -8.
\]

Thus, from this case, we have \(x = -8\).

### Step 4: Identify All Roots

The valid roots from both cases are:

- From Case 1: \(x = 8\)
- From Case 2: \(x = -8\)

### Step 5: Compute the Product of All Roots

Now, we compute the product of all the roots:

\[
\text{Product} = 8 \times (-8) = -64.
\]

### Conclusion

The product of all the roots of the equation 

\[
\sqrt{5 | x | + 8} = \sqrt{x^2 - 16}
\]

is 

\[
\boxed{-64}.
