To simplify the expression \(\frac{2s^5}{s^3} - 6s^2 + \frac{7s^3}{s}\), we will use the results from the previous simplifications:

1. **Simplifying \(\frac{2s^5}{s^3}\)**:
   \[
   \frac{2s^5}{s^3} = 2s^2
   \]

2. **The term \(-6s^2\)** is already in its simplest form:
   \[
   -6s^2
   \]

3. **Simplifying \(\frac{7s^3}{s}\)**:
   \[
   \frac{7s^3}{s} = 7s^2
   \]

Now, we can combine these simplified terms into a single expression:

\[
2s^2 - 6s^2 + 7s^2
\]

Next, we combine the like terms:

\[
(2 - 6 + 7)s^2 = (2 + 7 - 6)s^2 = 3s^2
\]

Thus, the final simplified expression is:

\[
\boxed{3s^2}
\] 

This comprehensive solution combines all the simplified terms and provides the final result clearly and accurately.
