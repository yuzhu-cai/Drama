To solve the problem, we will follow these steps:

1. **Identify the Outcomes of Each Spinner**: 
   - **Spinner I** has sections labeled: 2, 3, 4, 5 (4 outcomes).
   - **Spinner II** has sections labeled: 1, 3, 5, 7, 9 (5 outcomes).

2. **Calculate Total Outcomes**:
   - The total number of outcomes when both spinners are spun is:
   \[
   \text{Total Outcomes} = \text{Outcomes from Spinner I} \times \text{Outcomes from Spinner II} = 4 \times 5 = 20
   \]

3. **Calculate the Products**:
   We will calculate the products of each combination of outcomes from both spinners:

   - **When Spinner I = 2**:
     - \(2 \times 1 = 2\)
     - \(2 \times 3 = 6\)
     - \(2 \times 5 = 10\)
     - \(2 \times 7 = 14\)
     - \(2 \times 9 = 18\)

   - **When Spinner I = 3**:
     - \(3 \times 1 = 3\)
     - \(3 \times 3 = 9\)
     - \(3 \times 5 = 15\)
     - \(3 \times 7 = 21\)
     - \(3 \times 9 = 27\)

   - **When Spinner I = 4**:
     - \(4 \times 1 = 4\)
     - \(4 \times 3 = 12\)
     - \(4 \times 5 = 20\)
     - \(4 \times 7 = 28\)
     - \(4 \times 9 = 36\)

   - **When Spinner I = 5**:
     - \(5 \times 1 = 5\)
     - \(5 \times 3 = 15\)
     - \(5 \times 5 = 25\)
     - \(5 \times 7 = 35\)
     - \(5 \times 9 = 45\)

4. **List All Products**:
   The products from all combinations are:
   - From 2: 2, 6, 10, 14, 18
   - From 3: 3, 9, 15, 21, 27
   - From 4: 4, 12, 20, 28, 36
   - From 5: 5, 15, 25, 35, 45

   Combining these, we have the complete list of products:
   \[
   2, 6, 10, 14, 18, 3, 9, 15, 21, 27, 4, 12, 20, 28, 36, 5, 15, 25, 35, 45
   \]

5. **Identify Two-Digit Even Products**:
   Now, we will identify which of these products are two-digit even numbers:
   - The two-digit even numbers are: 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20, 22, 24, 26, 28, 30, 32, 34, 36, 38, 40, 42, 44, 46, 48, 50, 52, 54, 56, 58, 60, 62, 64, 66, 68, 70, 72, 74, 76, 78, 80, 82, 84, 86, 88, 90, 92, 94, 96, 98.

   From our products, the two-digit even products are:
   - 10, 12, 14, 20, 28, 36

   Thus, the favorable outcomes (two-digit even products) are:
   - 10, 12, 14, 20, 28, 36 (total of 6 favorable outcomes).

6. **Calculate the Probability**:
   The probability \( P \) that the product is a two-digit even number is given by the ratio of favorable outcomes to total outcomes:
   \[
   P(\text{two-digit even product}) = \frac{\text{Number of Favorable Outcomes}}{\text{Total Outcomes}} = \frac{6}{20}
   \]

   Simplifying this fraction:
   \[
   P(\text{two-digit even product}) = \frac{3}{10}
   \]

### Final Answer
The probability that the product of the numbers from Spinner I and Spinner II is a two-digit even number is:
\[
\boxed{\frac{3}{10}}
\]
