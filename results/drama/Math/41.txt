To simplify the expression \( 19x + 1 - 4x - 81 \), we will follow these steps:

1. **Identify Like Terms**: We have two types of terms in the expression:
   - The \( x \) terms: \( 19x \) and \( -4x \)
   - The constant terms: \( 1 \) and \( -81 \)

2. **Combine the \( x \) Terms**:
   \[
   19x - 4x = (19 - 4)x = 15x
   \]

3. **Combine the Constant Terms**:
   \[
   1 - 81 = -80
   \]

4. **Combine the Results**: Now we can put the combined \( x \) terms and the constant terms together:
   \[
   15x - 80
   \]

Thus, the expression \( 19x + 1 - 4x - 81 \) simplifies to:
\[
\boxed{15x - 80}
\]

This is the simplest form of the given expression, clearly showing the combined \( x \) terms and the constant term.
