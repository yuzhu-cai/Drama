To solve the problem, we need to analyze the two cubic polynomials given:

1. \( P(x) = x^3 + 5x^2 + px + q \)
2. \( Q(x) = x^3 + x^2 + px + r \)

### Step 1: Identify the Roots

Let the common roots of both polynomials be \( r_1 \) and \( r_2 \), and let the unique root of \( P(x) \) be \( r_3 \) and the unique root of \( Q(x) \) be \( r_4 \).

### Step 2: Apply Vieta's Formulas

Using Vieta's formulas for both polynomials:

For \( P(x) \):
- The sum of the roots \( r_1 + r_2 + r_3 = -5 \) (coefficient of \( x^2 \) is 5)
- The sum of the products of the roots taken two at a time \( r_1 r_2 + r_1 r_3 + r_2 r_3 = p \)
- The product of the roots \( r_1 r_2 r_3 = -q \)

For \( Q(x) \):
- The sum of the roots \( r_1 + r_2 + r_4 = -1 \) (coefficient of \( x^2 \) is 1)
- The sum of the products of the roots taken two at a time \( r_1 r_2 + r_1 r_4 + r_2 r_4 = p \)
- The product of the roots \( r_1 r_2 r_4 = -r \)

### Step 3: Set Up the Equations

From the sums of the roots, we can set up the following equations:

1. From \( P(x) \):
   \[
   r_1 + r_2 + r_3 = -5 \quad (1)
   \]

2. From \( Q(x) \):
   \[
   r_1 + r_2 + r_4 = -1 \quad (2)
   \]

### Step 4: Solve for \( r_3 \) and \( r_4 \)

Subtract equation (1) from equation (2):

\[
(r_1 + r_2 + r_4) - (r_1 + r_2 + r_3) = -1 - (-5)
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
r_4 - r_3 = 4
\]

Thus, we can express \( r_4 \) in terms of \( r_3 \):

\[
r_4 = r_3 + 4 \quad (3)
\]

### Step 5: Find the Sum of the Unique Roots

The sum of the unique roots \( r_3 \) and \( r_4 \) can be calculated as follows:

Using equation (3):

\[
r_3 + r_4 = r_3 + (r_3 + 4) = 2r_3 + 4
\]

### Step 6: Express \( r_3 \) in Terms of Known Values

From equation (1), we can express \( r_3 \):

\[
r_3 = -5 - (r_1 + r_2)
\]

Substituting this into the sum of the unique roots:

\[
r_3 + r_4 = 2(-5 - (r_1 + r_2)) + 4
\]
\[
= -10 - 2(r_1 + r_2) + 4
\]
\[
= -6 - 2(r_1 + r_2)
\]

### Step 7: Final Result

To find the exact value of \( r_1 + r_2 \), we would need additional information about \( p \) and \( q \) or specific values for the roots. However, we have established the relationship between the unique roots.

Thus, the sum of the two roots that are not common to both polynomials is expressed as:

\[
\text{Sum of unique roots} = -6 - 2(r_1 + r_2)
\]

If \( r_1 + r_2 \) can be determined from the values of \( p \) and \( q \), we can substitute that value to find the numerical answer. If you have specific values for \( p \), \( q \), or any additional conditions, please provide them for a complete numerical solution!
