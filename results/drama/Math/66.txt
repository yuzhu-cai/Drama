To solve for \( f(2015) \) given the functional equation 

\[
f(4xy) = 2y[f(x + y) + f(x - y)]
\]

and the known value \( f(5) = 3 \), we will analyze the functional equation and derive more values of \( f \).

### Step 1: Substitute \( x = 1 \) and \( y = 1 \)

Substituting \( x = 1 \) and \( y = 1 \) into the functional equation gives:

\[
f(4 \cdot 1 \cdot 1) = 2 \cdot 1 [f(1 + 1) + f(1 - 1)]
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
f(4) = 2[f(2) + f(0)]
\]

### Step 2: Substitute \( x = 0 \) and \( y = 0 \)

Substituting \( x = 0 \) and \( y = 0 \):

\[
f(4 \cdot 0 \cdot 0) = 2 \cdot 0 [f(0 + 0) + f(0 - 0)]
\]

This gives us:

\[
f(0) = 0
\]

### Step 3: Substitute \( y = 1 \)

Now substituting \( y = 1 \):

\[
f(4x) = 2[f(x + 1) + f(x - 1)]
\]

### Step 4: Substitute \( x = 2 \) and \( y = 1 \)

Next, substituting \( x = 2 \) and \( y = 1 \):

\[
f(8) = 2[f(3) + f(1)]
\]

### Step 5: Substitute \( x = 5 \) and \( y = 1 \)

Now substituting \( x = 5 \) and \( y = 1 \):

\[
f(20) = 2[f(6) + f(4)]
\]

### Step 6: Find \( f(4) \)

From the earlier equation \( f(4) = 2[f(2) + f(0)] \) and knowing \( f(0) = 0 \):

\[
f(4) = 2f(2)
\]

### Step 7: Find \( f(2) \)

Next, we need to find \( f(2) \). We can substitute \( x = 1 \) and \( y = 2 \):

\[
f(8) = 2[f(3) + f(-1)]
\]

### Step 8: Assume a Form for \( f \)

Given the structure of the functional equation, we can assume \( f(x) \) is a linear function of the form \( f(x) = ax + b \). We already know \( f(5) = 3 \), which gives us:

\[
5a + b = 3
\]

From \( f(0) = 0 \), we have \( b = 0 \). Thus, \( f(x) = ax \).

### Step 9: Substitute Back to Find \( a \)

Using \( f(5) = 3 \):

\[
5a = 3 \implies a = \frac{3}{5}
\]

Thus, the function is:

\[
f(x) = \frac{3}{5}x
\]

### Step 10: Calculate \( f(2015) \)

Now we can calculate \( f(2015) \):

\[
f(2015) = \frac{3}{5} \cdot 2015 = \frac{3 \cdot 2015}{5} = \frac{6045}{5} = 1209
\]

### Conclusion

The value of \( f(2015) \) is 

\[
\boxed{1209}.
