To solve the problem of finding how many rectangles can be formed with the given nonadjacent vertices \( (4, 3) \) and \( (-4, -3) \), where the other two vertices must have integer coordinates, we will follow these steps:

### Step 1: Identify the Midpoint
First, we calculate the midpoint of the diagonal formed by the two given vertices. The midpoint \( M \) is calculated using the midpoint formula:

\[
M = \left( \frac{x_1 + x_2}{2}, \frac{y_1 + y_2}{2} \right)
\]

Substituting the coordinates of the vertices \( (4, 3) \) and \( (-4, -3) \):

\[
M = \left( \frac{4 + (-4)}{2}, \frac{3 + (-3)}{2} \right) = \left( \frac{0}{2}, \frac{0}{2} \right) = (0, 0)
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the Lengths of the Sides
Next, we calculate the lengths of the sides of the rectangle. The distance between the two given vertices (the diagonal) can be calculated using the distance formula:

\[
d = \sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2}
\]

Substituting the coordinates:

\[
d = \sqrt{((-4) - 4)^2 + ((-3) - 3)^2} = \sqrt{(-8)^2 + (-6)^2} = \sqrt{64 + 36} = \sqrt{100} = 10
\]

### Step 3: Determine the Side Lengths
Let the lengths of the sides of the rectangle be \( l \) and \( w \). According to the properties of rectangles, the relationship between the diagonal \( d \) and the sides is given by:

\[
d = \sqrt{l^2 + w^2}
\]

From our calculation, we have \( d = 10 \):

\[
10 = \sqrt{l^2 + w^2}
\]

Squaring both sides gives:

\[
100 = l^2 + w^2
\]

### Step 4: Find Integer Solutions for \( l \) and \( w \)
We need to find pairs of integers \( (l, w) \) such that:

\[
l^2 + w^2 = 100
\]

This is equivalent to finding integer solutions to the equation. We can list the pairs \( (l, w) \) that satisfy this equation:

- \( (10, 0) \)
- \( (0, 10) \)
- \( (6, 8) \)
- \( (8, 6) \)
- \( (7, 7) \)

### Step 5: Count Valid Rectangles
For each pair \( (l, w) \), we can find the coordinates of the other two vertices \( B \) and \( C \) based on the properties of rectangles. The coordinates of the other two vertices can be determined by moving \( l \) units horizontally and \( w \) units vertically from the midpoint \( (0, 0) \).

1. **For \( (10, 0) \)**:
   - Vertices: \( (5, 0) \) and \( (-5, 0) \)
2. **For \( (0, 10) \)**:
   - Vertices: \( (0, 5) \) and \( (0, -5) \)
3. **For \( (6, 8) \)**:
   - Vertices: \( (3, 4) \) and \( (-3, -4) \)
4. **For \( (8, 6) \)**:
   - Vertices: \( (4, 3) \) and \( (-4, -3) \) (already given)
5. **For \( (7, 7) \)**:
   - Vertices: \( (3.5, 3.5) \) and \( (-3.5, -3.5) \) (not valid since not integers)

### Conclusion
The valid pairs of integer coordinates for the other two vertices are derived from the pairs \( (6, 8) \) and \( (8, 6) \). 

Thus, the total number of rectangles that can be formed with the given conditions is **4**:

1. Rectangle with vertices \( (4, 3), (-4, -3), (5, 0), (-5, 0) \)
2. Rectangle with vertices \( (4, 3), (-4, -3), (0, 5), (0, -5) \)
3. Rectangle with vertices \( (4, 3), (-4, -3), (3, 4), (-3, -4) \)
4. Rectangle with vertices \( (4, 3), (-4, -3), (4, -3), (-4, 3) \)

Therefore, the final answer is that there are **3 valid rectangles** that satisfy the conditions of the problem.
