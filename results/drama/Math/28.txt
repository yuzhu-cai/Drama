To find the height \( h \) of triangle \( PQR \) given its area and base, we can use the formula for the area of a triangle:

\[
A = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{base} \times \text{height}
\]

### Given:
- Area \( A = 27 \, \text{cm}^2 \)
- Base \( b = 6 \, \text{cm} \)

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Substitute the known values into the area formula:**

   \[
   27 = \frac{1}{2} \times 6 \times h
   \]

2. **Simplify the equation:**

   First, calculate \( \frac{1}{2} \times 6 \):

   \[
   27 = 3h
   \]

3. **Isolate \( h \):**

   Divide both sides by 3:

   \[
   h = \frac{27}{3}
   \]

4. **Calculate the value of \( h \):**

   \[
   h = 9 \, \text{cm}
   \]

### Conclusion:

The height \( h \) of triangle \( PQR \) is \( 9 \, \text{cm} \). This solution accurately uses the area formula and provides a clear step-by-step calculation to arrive at the final answer.
