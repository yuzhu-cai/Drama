To solve the problem, we start with the given condition that when a number \( n \) is divided by 5, the remainder is 3. This can be expressed mathematically as:

\[
n \equiv 3 \mod 5
\]

### Step 1: Express \( n \) in terms of modular arithmetic
From the condition, we can express \( n \) as:

\[
n = 5k + 3
\]

for some integer \( k \).

### Step 2: Calculate \( 2n \)
Next, we want to find \( 2n \):

\[
2n = 2(5k + 3) = 10k + 6
\]

### Step 3: Find \( 2n \mod 5 \)
Now, we need to determine the remainder when \( 2n \) is divided by 5. We can simplify \( 10k + 6 \) modulo 5:

1. The term \( 10k \) is divisible by 5, so:
   \[
   10k \mod 5 \equiv 0
   \]

2. Now, consider the term \( 6 \mod 5 \):
   \[
   6 \mod 5 \equiv 1
   \]

### Step 4: Combine the results
Putting it all together, we have:

\[
2n \equiv 10k + 6 \equiv 0 + 1 \equiv 1 \mod 5
\]

### Conclusion
Thus, the remainder when twice the number \( n \) is divided by 5 is:

\[
\boxed{1}
\] 

This comprehensive solution clearly outlines the steps taken to arrive at the final answer, addressing all aspects of the original query.
