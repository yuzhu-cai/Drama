To solve the problem, we need to find the value of \( n \) such that the sum of the first \( n \) terms of the infinite geometric sequence \( \left\{\frac{1}{4}, \frac{1}{8}, \frac{1}{16}, \dots \right\} \) equals \( \frac{255}{512} \).

### Step 1: Identify the First Term and Common Ratio

The first term \( a \) of the sequence is:

\[
a = \frac{1}{4}
\]

The common ratio \( r \) can be calculated by dividing the second term by the first term:

\[
r = \frac{\frac{1}{8}}{\frac{1}{4}} = \frac{1}{2}
\]

### Step 2: Use the Formula for the Sum of the First \( n \) Terms

The formula for the sum \( S_n \) of the first \( n \) terms of a geometric series is:

\[
S_n = a \frac{1 - r^n}{1 - r}
\]

Substituting the values of \( a \) and \( r \):

\[
S_n = \frac{1}{4} \frac{1 - \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^n}{1 - \frac{1}{2}} = \frac{1}{4} \frac{1 - \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^n}{\frac{1}{2}} = \frac{1}{4} \cdot 2 \left(1 - \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^n\right) = \frac{1}{2} \left(1 - \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^n\right)
\]

### Step 3: Set the Sum Equal to \( \frac{255}{512} \)

Now we set the sum equal to \( \frac{255}{512} \):

\[
\frac{1}{2} \left(1 - \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^n\right) = \frac{255}{512}
\]

Multiplying both sides by 2 to eliminate the fraction:

\[
1 - \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^n = \frac{255}{256}
\]

### Step 4: Solve for \( \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^n \)

Rearranging gives:

\[
\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^n = 1 - \frac{255}{256} = \frac{1}{256}
\]

### Step 5: Solve for \( n \)

Recognizing that \( \frac{1}{256} = \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^8 \), we can equate the exponents:

\[
\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^n = \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^8 \implies n = 8
\]

### Conclusion

Thus, the value of \( n \) such that the sum of the first \( n \) terms of the geometric sequence equals \( \frac{255}{512} \) is:

\[
\boxed{8}
\]

This solution is clear and accurately addresses all aspects of the problem, confirming that the sum of the first 8 terms of the given geometric sequence is indeed \( \frac{255}{512} \).
