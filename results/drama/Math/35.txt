To solve the original query, "What number is 5% of 10% of 1200?", we will synthesize the results from the completed subtasks.

### Step 1: Calculate 10% of 1200
From the previous calculation, we found that:
\[
10\% \text{ of } 1200 = 120
\]

### Step 2: Calculate 5% of the result from Step 1
Now, we need to calculate 5% of the result obtained in Step 1, which is 120.

Using the formula for calculating a percentage:
\[
5\% \text{ of } 120 = \frac{5}{100} \times 120 = 0.05 \times 120
\]

Calculating this gives:
\[
0.05 \times 120 = 6
\]

### Final Result
Thus, the comprehensive solution to the original query is:
\[
\text{5% of 10% of 1200 is } 6.
\]
