To solve the equation 

\[
\frac{\sqrt[3]{2x-4}}{\sqrt[3]{x+4}} = 2,
\]

we will follow these steps:

### Step 1: Eliminate the fraction

Multiply both sides by \(\sqrt[3]{x+4}\):

\[
\sqrt[3]{2x-4} = 2\sqrt[3]{x+4}.
\]

### Step 2: Cube both sides

To eliminate the cube roots, cube both sides of the equation:

\[
(\sqrt[3]{2x-4})^3 = (2\sqrt[3]{x+4})^3.
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
2x - 4 = 8(x + 4).
\]

### Step 3: Expand and simplify

Now, expand the right side:

\[
2x - 4 = 8x + 32.
\]

Next, move all terms involving \(x\) to one side and constant terms to the other side:

\[
2x - 8x = 32 + 4.
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
-6x = 36.
\]

### Step 4: Solve for \(x\)

Now, divide both sides by \(-6\):

\[
x = -6.
\]

### Step 5: Check the solution

To verify the solution, substitute \(x = -6\) back into the original equation:

1. Calculate \(2x - 4\) and \(x + 4\):

   \[
   2(-6) - 4 = -12 - 4 = -16,
   \]
   \[
   -6 + 4 = -2.
   \]

2. Substitute these values into the left side of the original equation:

   \[
   \frac{\sqrt[3]{-16}}{\sqrt[3]{-2}}.
   \]

3. Simplify:

   \[
   \frac{-2}{-1} = 2.
   \]

Since both sides of the original equation are equal, the solution is verified.

### Final Answer

Thus, the solution to the equation 

\[
\frac{\sqrt[3]{2x-4}}{\sqrt[3]{x+4}} = 2
\]

is 

\[
\boxed{-6}.
