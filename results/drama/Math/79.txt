To solve the recurrence relation given by 

\[
a_n = 24 - 5a_{n - 1}
\]

with the initial condition \( a_1 = 14 \), we will first find a general formula for \( a_n \) and then express it in the form \( a_n = p \cdot q^n + r \).

### Step 1: Finding the Characteristic Equation

The recurrence relation can be rearranged as:

\[
a_n + 5a_{n - 1} = 24
\]

This is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence relation. To solve it, we first find the homogeneous part:

\[
a_n + 5a_{n - 1} = 0
\]

The characteristic equation for this homogeneous part is:

\[
r + 5 = 0 \implies r = -5
\]

### Step 2: Finding the Particular Solution

Next, we look for a particular solution to the non-homogeneous equation. Since the non-homogeneous part is a constant (24), we can try a constant solution \( a_n = A \). Substituting this into the recurrence gives:

\[
A = 24 - 5A
\]

Solving for \( A \):

\[
A + 5A = 24 \implies 6A = 24 \implies A = 4
\]

### Step 3: General Solution

The general solution to the recurrence relation is the sum of the homogeneous solution and the particular solution:

\[
a_n = C(-5)^n + 4
\]

where \( C \) is a constant determined by the initial condition.

### Step 4: Applying the Initial Condition

Using the initial condition \( a_1 = 14 \):

\[
a_1 = C(-5)^1 + 4 = 14
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
-5C + 4 = 14
\]

Solving for \( C \):

\[
-5C = 14 - 4 \implies -5C = 10 \implies C = -2
\]

### Step 5: Final Formula for \( a_n \)

Substituting \( C \) back into the general solution gives:

\[
a_n = -2(-5)^n + 4
\]

This can be rewritten as:

\[
a_n = 2 \cdot 5^n + 4
\]

### Step 6: Identifying Constants \( p \), \( q \), and \( r \)

From the expression \( a_n = p \cdot q^n + r \), we can identify:

- \( p = 2 \)
- \( q = 5 \)
- \( r = 4 \)

### Step 7: Calculating \( p + q + r \)

Now, we calculate:

\[
p + q + r = 2 + 5 + 4 = 11
\]

### Conclusion

Thus, the final answer is:

\[
\boxed{11}
\]
