To determine the number of solutions for the equation 

\[
x^2 = -|x|,
\]

we will analyze the equation by considering two cases: when \( x \) is non-negative and when \( x \) is negative.

### Case 1: \( x \geq 0 \)

In this case, the absolute value function simplifies to \( |x| = x \). Therefore, the equation becomes:

\[
x^2 = -x.
\]

Rearranging this gives:

\[
x^2 + x = 0.
\]

Factoring out \( x \):

\[
x(x + 1) = 0.
\]

Setting each factor to zero gives us the solutions:

1. \( x = 0 \)
2. \( x + 1 = 0 \) which leads to \( x = -1 \) (not valid in this case since \( x \) must be non-negative).

Thus, from Case 1, the only valid solution is:

\[
x = 0.
\]

### Case 2: \( x < 0 \)

In this case, the absolute value function simplifies to \( |x| = -x \). Therefore, the equation becomes:

\[
x^2 = -(-x) \implies x^2 = x.
\]

Rearranging this gives:

\[
x^2 - x = 0.
\]

Factoring out \( x \):

\[
x(x - 1) = 0.
\]

Setting each factor to zero gives us the solutions:

1. \( x = 0 \) (not valid in this case since \( x \) must be negative).
2. \( x - 1 = 0 \) which leads to \( x = 1 \) (not valid in this case since \( x \) must be negative).

Thus, from Case 2, there are no valid solutions.

### Summary of Solutions

Combining the results from both cases:

- From Case 1 (\( x \geq 0 \)), we found one valid solution: \( x = 0 \).
- From Case 2 (\( x < 0 \)), we found no valid solutions.

### Conclusion

The total number of valid solutions for the equation 

\[
x^2 = -|x|
\]

is 

\[
\boxed{1}.
\] 

The only solution is \( x = 0 \).
