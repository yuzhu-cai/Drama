To determine how many numbers are in the list \( 6, 7, 10, 11, 14, 15, \ldots, 94, 95, 98 \), we first need to identify the pattern in the sequence.

### Step 1: Identify the Pattern
The numbers in the list can be grouped as follows:
- The first group consists of \( 6, 7 \).
- The second group consists of \( 10, 11 \).
- The third group consists of \( 14, 15 \).
- This pattern continues, with each group containing two consecutive numbers.

### Step 2: Identify the Starting and Ending Points
From the list, we can see:
- The first number is \( 6 \).
- The last number is \( 98 \).

### Step 3: Determine the Groups
The groups can be identified by their starting points:
- The first group starts at \( 6 \) (Group 1).
- The second group starts at \( 10 \) (Group 2).
- The third group starts at \( 14 \) (Group 3).
- Continuing this pattern, we can see that each group starts at \( 6 + 4n \) where \( n \) is the group number starting from \( 0 \).

### Step 4: Find the Last Group
To find the last group, we need to determine how many groups fit into the range up to \( 98 \):
- The starting points of the groups are \( 6, 10, 14, \ldots \).
- This sequence can be expressed as \( 6 + 4n \) where \( n \) is a non-negative integer.

Setting \( 6 + 4n \leq 98 \):
\[
4n \leq 92 \\
n \leq 23
\]
Thus, \( n \) can take values from \( 0 \) to \( 23 \), giving us \( 24 \) groups.

### Step 5: Count the Numbers
Since each group contains \( 2 \) numbers:
\[
\text{Total numbers} = 24 \text{ groups} \times 2 \text{ numbers/group} = 48
\]

### Conclusion
The total number of terms in the list \( 6, 7, 10, 11, 14, 15, \ldots, 94, 95, 98 \) is \( \boxed{48} \).
