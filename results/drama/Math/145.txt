To solve the problem, we start with the given modular equations:

1. \( a + b \equiv 2 \pmod{10} \)
2. \( 2a + b \equiv 1 \pmod{10} \)

### Step 1: Solve for \( b \) in terms of \( a \)

From the first equation, we can express \( b \) in terms of \( a \):
\[
b \equiv 2 - a \pmod{10}
\]

### Step 2: Substitute \( b \) into the second equation

Now, we substitute this expression for \( b \) into the second equation:
\[
2a + (2 - a) \equiv 1 \pmod{10}
\]

### Step 3: Simplify the equation

Simplifying the left-hand side:
\[
2a + 2 - a \equiv 1 \pmod{10}
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
a + 2 \equiv 1 \pmod{10}
\]

### Step 4: Solve for \( a \)

Now, isolate \( a \):
\[
a \equiv 1 - 2 \pmod{10}
\]
\[
a \equiv -1 \pmod{10}
\]
Since \(-1\) is equivalent to \(9\) in modulo \(10\):
\[
a \equiv 9 \pmod{10}
\]

### Step 5: Substitute \( a \) back to find \( b \)

Now that we have \( a \), we can substitute it back into the expression for \( b \):
\[
b \equiv 2 - a \pmod{10}
\]
Substituting \( a = 9 \):
\[
b \equiv 2 - 9 \pmod{10}
\]
\[
b \equiv -7 \pmod{10}
\]
Since \(-7\) is equivalent to \(3\) in modulo \(10\):
\[
b \equiv 3 \pmod{10}
\]

### Step 6: Calculate \( a - b \)

Now we have:
- \( a \equiv 9 \)
- \( b \equiv 3 \)

We can calculate \( a - b \):
\[
a - b \equiv 9 - 3 \equiv 6 \pmod{10}
\]

### Step 7: Determine the last digit of \( a - b \)

The last digit of \( a - b \) is:
\[
\boxed{6}
\]
