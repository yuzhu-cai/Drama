To synthesize the results and provide a comprehensive solution to the original query regarding the parameterized line given by:

\[
\begin{pmatrix} x \\ y \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} -3 \\ -4 \end{pmatrix} + t \begin{pmatrix} 7 \\ -2 \end{pmatrix},
\]

we will follow these steps:

### Step 1: Identify the Direction Vector and Slope

From the parameterization, we can identify:
- A point on the line: \((-3, -4)\)
- The direction vector: \((7, -2)\)

The slope \(m\) of the line can be calculated using the components of the direction vector:

\[
m = \frac{\Delta y}{\Delta x} = \frac{-2}{7}.
\]

### Step 2: Find the y-Intercept (b)

To express the equation in the form \(y = mx + b\), we need to find the y-intercept \(b\). We can use the point \((-3, -4)\) to find \(b\).

1. Substitute \(x = -3\) and \(y = -4\) into the equation \(y = mx + b\):

\[
-4 = \left(-\frac{2}{7}\right)(-3) + b.
\]

2. Simplify the equation:

\[
-4 = \frac{6}{7} + b.
\]

3. Solve for \(b\):

\[
b = -4 - \frac{6}{7} = -\frac{28}{7} - \frac{6}{7} = -\frac{34}{7}.
\]

### Step 3: Write the Equation of the Line

Now we can express the equation of the line in slope-intercept form:

\[
y = -\frac{2}{7}x - \frac{34}{7}.
\]

### Step 4: Determine the Ordered Pair \((m, b)\)

From the equation \(y = -\frac{2}{7}x - \frac{34}{7}\), we have:
- Slope \(m = -\frac{2}{7}\)
- y-intercept \(b = -\frac{34}{7}\)

Thus, the ordered pair \((m, b)\) is:

\[
\boxed{\left(-\frac{2}{7}, -\frac{34}{7}\right)}.
\]

This solution clearly addresses all aspects of the problem, providing the necessary calculations and final results.
