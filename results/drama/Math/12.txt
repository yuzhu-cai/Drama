To determine how many real numbers \( x \) satisfy the equation 

\[
\frac{1}{5} \log_2 x = \sin(5\pi x),
\]

we will analyze both sides of the equation and find their points of intersection.

### Step 1: Analyze the Functions

1. **Left Side: \( f(x) = \frac{1}{5} \log_2 x \)**
   - **Domain**: \( x > 0 \)
   - **Range**: \( (-\infty, \infty) \)
   - **Behavior**: 
     - As \( x \to 0^+ \), \( f(x) \to -\infty \).
     - As \( x \to \infty \), \( f(x) \to \infty \).
   - **Monotonicity**: The function is increasing for \( x > 0 \).

2. **Right Side: \( g(x) = \sin(5\pi x) \)**
   - **Domain**: \( x \in \mathbb{R} \)
   - **Range**: \( [-1, 1] \)
   - **Period**: \( \frac{2}{5} \)
   - **Behavior**: The sine function oscillates between -1 and 1.

### Step 2: Set Up the Equation

We need to find the points of intersection of \( f(x) \) and \( g(x) \):

\[
\frac{1}{5} \log_2 x = \sin(5\pi x).
\]

### Step 3: Graphical Analysis

To estimate the number of solutions, we can graph both functions:

- **Graph of \( f(x) \)**: This function starts from \( -\infty \) when \( x \) approaches 0 and increases without bound as \( x \) increases.
- **Graph of \( g(x) \)**: This function oscillates between -1 and 1 with a period of \( \frac{2}{5} \).

### Step 4: Finding Intersections

1. **Behavior of \( f(x) \)**:
   - Since \( f(x) \) is increasing and can take any value from \( -\infty \) to \( \infty \), it will intersect the oscillating sine function multiple times.

2. **Range of \( g(x) \)**:
   - The sine function oscillates between -1 and 1. Therefore, we need to find where \( f(x) \) intersects this range.

3. **Finding Intervals**:
   - Set \( \frac{1}{5} \log_2 x = 1 \) and \( \frac{1}{5} \log_2 x = -1 \) to find the bounds for \( x \):
     - For \( \frac{1}{5} \log_2 x = 1 \):
       \[
       \log_2 x = 5 \implies x = 2^5 = 32.
       \]
     - For \( \frac{1}{5} \log_2 x = -1 \):
       \[
       \log_2 x = -5 \implies x = 2^{-5} = \frac{1}{32}.
       \]

### Step 5: Count the Intersections

- The function \( g(x) \) oscillates between -1 and 1, and since \( f(x) \) is increasing from \( -\infty \) to \( \infty \), it will intersect \( g(x) \) multiple times in the interval \( \left(\frac{1}{32}, 32\right) \).
- The period of \( g(x) \) is \( \frac{2}{5} \), which means it completes several cycles in this interval.

### Step 6: Estimate the Number of Solutions

To estimate the number of solutions:
- The interval \( \left(\frac{1}{32}, 32\right) \) has a length of \( 32 - \frac{1}{32} \approx 31.96875 \).
- The number of complete cycles of \( g(x) \) in this interval is approximately:
  \[
  \text{Number of cycles} = \frac{31.96875}{\frac{2}{5}} = 31.96875 \times \frac{5}{2} \approx 79.921875.
  \]
- Since \( g(x) \) oscillates between -1 and 1, it will intersect \( f(x) \) twice per cycle (once when increasing and once when decreasing).

### Conclusion

Thus, the total number of real solutions is approximately:

\[
2 \times 79 \approx 158.
\]

Therefore, the equation \( \frac{1}{5} \log_2 x = \sin(5\pi x) \) has approximately **158 real solutions**.
