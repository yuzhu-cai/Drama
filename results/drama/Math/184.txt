To determine the probability that Joe will get three hits in three at-bats, we can use the probability of him getting a hit in a single at-bat, which is given as his batting average of \( 0.323 \).

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Identify the Probability of a Hit**:
   - The probability of Joe getting a hit in one at-bat is \( p = 0.323 \).

2. **Calculate the Probability of Three Hits in Three At-Bats**:
   - Since the at-bats are independent events, the probability of Joe getting three hits in three at-bats can be calculated using the formula for independent events:
   \[
   P(\text{3 hits in 3 at-bats}) = p \times p \times p = p^3
   \]
   - Substituting the value of \( p \):
   \[
   P(\text{3 hits}) = (0.323)^3
   \]

3. **Calculate \( (0.323)^3 \)**:
   \[
   (0.323)^3 = 0.0338 \quad (\text{approximately})
   \]

4. **Round to the Nearest Hundredth**:
   - To express this probability as a decimal to the nearest hundredth, we round \( 0.0338 \):
   \[
   0.0338 \approx 0.03
   \]

### Final Answer:
The probability that Joe will get three hits in three at-bats is approximately **0.03** when expressed as a decimal to the nearest hundredth.
