To solve the problem "Three plus the reciprocal of a number equals 7 divided by that number," we can break it down into clear steps and synthesize the results.

### Step 1: Set Up the Equation

We start by translating the statement into a mathematical equation. Let \( x \) be the unknown number. The statement can be expressed as:

\[
3 + \frac{1}{x} = \frac{7}{x}
\]

### Step 2: Eliminate the Fractions

To eliminate the fractions, we can multiply both sides of the equation by \( x \) (assuming \( x \neq 0 \)):

\[
x \left(3 + \frac{1}{x}\right) = x \left(\frac{7}{x}\right)
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
3x + 1 = 7
\]

### Step 3: Rearrange to Standard Quadratic Form

Next, we rearrange the equation to isolate terms on one side:

\[
3x + 1 - 7 = 0
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
3x - 6 = 0
\]

### Step 4: Solve for \( x \)

Now, we can solve for \( x \):

1. Add 6 to both sides:
   \[
   3x = 6
   \]

2. Divide both sides by 3:
   \[
   x = 2
   \]

### Step 5: Verify the Solution

To ensure that our solution is correct, we substitute \( x = 2 \) back into the original equation:

1. Substitute \( x = 2 \):
   \[
   3 + \frac{1}{2} = \frac{7}{2}
   \]

2. Simplify the left-hand side:
   \[
   3 + 0.5 = 3.5 \quad \text{(or } \frac{7}{2} \text{)}
   \]

3. Compare both sides:
   \[
   3.5 = 3.5 \quad \text{(True)}
   \]

### Conclusion

The solution to the original query is that the number is:

\[
\boxed{2}
\]

This comprehensive solution includes setting up the equation, eliminating fractions, rearranging to standard form, solving for \( x \), and verifying the solution to ensure accuracy.
