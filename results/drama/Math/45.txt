The original query was to add 313.9 to 12.6 and express the result as a decimal. 

Hereâ€™s the step-by-step breakdown of the addition:

1. **Align the numbers by their decimal points**:
   ```
     313.9
   +  12.6
   ```

2. **Add the numbers column by column**:
   - **Tenths place**: \(9 + 6 = 15\). Write down 5 and carry over 1.
   - **Units place**: \(3 + 2 + 1 \text{ (carry)} = 6\).
   - **Tens place**: \(1 + 1 = 2\).
   - **Hundreds place**: \(3 + 0 = 3\).

3. **Combine the results**:
   ```
     313.9
   +  12.6
   ---------
     326.5
   ```

The final result of adding 313.9 and 12.6 is **326.5**.

Thus, expressed as a decimal, the answer is **326.5**.
