To determine the value of \( y \) based on the provided diagram and the relationships between angles, we can analyze the situation as follows:

1. **Understanding the Diagram**: The diagram depicts a right angle formed by two lines, with an arc indicating a rotation. The angle \( y \) is positioned in the third quadrant, suggesting that it is measured from the positive x-axis in a counterclockwise direction.

2. **Identifying the Angle Relationships**: 
   - The right angle formed at the origin (0 degrees) is \( 90^\circ \).
   - The angle \( y \) is measured in the counterclockwise direction from the positive x-axis, which means it is related to the full rotation of \( 360^\circ \).

3. **Calculating the Value of \( y \)**:
   - Since \( y \) is in the third quadrant, we can express it as:
     \[
     y = 360^\circ - 90^\circ = 270^\circ
     \]

4. **Conclusion**: Therefore, the value of \( y \) is:
   \[
   \boxed{270^\circ}
   \]

This solution synthesizes the relationships and principles relevant to the angle \( y \) in the context of the diagram, confirming that \( y \) measures \( 270^\circ \).
