To solve the original query, we need to evaluate the expression:

\[
\frac{7 + 21}{14 + 42}
\]

We have already calculated the numerator and denominator in the previous subtasks:

1. **Numerator**: 
   \[
   7 + 21 = 28
   \]

2. **Denominator**: 
   \[
   14 + 42 = 56
   \]

Now, we can substitute these results into the fraction:

\[
\frac{28}{56}
\]

Next, we simplify the fraction. Both the numerator and the denominator can be divided by their greatest common divisor, which is 28:

\[
\frac{28 \div 28}{56 \div 28} = \frac{1}{2}
\]

Thus, the value of the expression \(\frac{7 + 21}{14 + 42}\) is 

\[
\boxed{\frac{1}{2}}.
\]
