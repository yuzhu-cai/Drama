To solve the problem, we will follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the circumference of the ceiling fan.**
2. **Determine the distance traveled by the housefly in one minute.**
3. **Calculate the total time it took for the housefly to travel \( 19,404\pi \) feet.**

### Step 1: Calculate the Circumference of the Ceiling Fan

The diameter of the ceiling fan is given as 6 feet. The circumference \( C \) can be calculated using the formula:

\[
C = \pi \times d = \pi \times 6 = 6\pi \text{ feet}
\]

### Step 2: Determine the Distance Traveled by the Housefly in One Minute

The fan rotates at a rate of 20 revolutions per minute. Therefore, the distance traveled by the housefly in one minute is:

\[
\text{Distance per minute} = \text{Circumference} \times \text{Revolutions per minute} = 6\pi \times 20 = 120\pi \text{ feet}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the Total Time to Travel \( 19,404\pi \) Feet

Now, we need to find the time it took for the housefly to travel \( 19,404\pi \) feet. We use the formula for time:

\[
\text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{19,404\pi}{120\pi}
\]

The \( \pi \) cancels out:

\[
\text{Time} = \frac{19,404}{120}
\]

Now, we perform the division:

\[
\text{Time} = 161.7 \text{ minutes}
\]

### Final Step: Round to the Nearest Whole Number

Rounding \( 161.7 \) to the nearest whole number gives us:

\[
\text{Time} \approx 162 \text{ minutes}
\]

### Conclusion

The total time the housefly had been on the fan during the time it took to travel \( 19,404\pi \) feet is approximately **162 minutes**.
