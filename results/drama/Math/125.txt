To solve the equation \(\sqrt{19 + 3y} = 7\), we will follow these steps:

### Step 1: Square both sides
To eliminate the square root, we square both sides of the equation:
\[
(\sqrt{19 + 3y})^2 = 7^2
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
19 + 3y = 49
\]

### Step 2: Rearrange the equation
Next, we need to isolate \(y\). We start by subtracting 19 from both sides:
\[
3y = 49 - 19
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
3y = 30
\]

### Step 3: Solve for \(y\)
Now, we divide both sides by 3 to solve for \(y\):
\[
y = \frac{30}{3}
\]
This gives us:
\[
y = 10
\]

### Conclusion
The solution to the equation \(\sqrt{19 + 3y} = 7\) is:
\[
\boxed{10}
\]

### Verification
To ensure our solution is correct, we can substitute \(y = 10\) back into the original equation:
\[
\sqrt{19 + 3(10)} = \sqrt{19 + 30} = \sqrt{49} = 7
\]
Since both sides of the original equation are equal, our solution \(y = 10\) is verified and correct.
