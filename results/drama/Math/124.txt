To solve the original equation \( x(x - 3) = 1 \) and express the solutions in the specified form, we followed these steps:

1. **Rearranging the Equation**: 
   We started with the equation:
   \[
   x(x - 3) = 1
   \]
   Rearranging it into standard quadratic form gives:
   \[
   x^2 - 3x - 1 = 0
   \]
   Here, we identified \( a = 1 \), \( b = -3 \), and \( c = -1 \).

2. **Using the Quadratic Formula**:
   The quadratic formula is:
   \[
   x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}
   \]
   Substituting \( a = 1 \), \( b = -3 \), and \( c = -1 \):
   \[
   x = \frac{-(-3) \pm \sqrt{(-3)^2 - 4 \cdot 1 \cdot (-1)}}{2 \cdot 1}
   \]
   Simplifying this:
   \[
   x = \frac{3 \pm \sqrt{9 + 4}}{2} = \frac{3 \pm \sqrt{13}}{2}
   \]

3. **Expressing in the Required Form**:
   The solutions can be expressed as:
   \[
   x_1 = \frac{3 + \sqrt{13}}{2} \quad \text{and} \quad x_2 = \frac{3 - \sqrt{13}}{2}
   \]
   Here, we identify:
   - \( a = 3 \)
   - \( b = 13 \)
   - \( c = 2 \)

4. **Identifying Prime Numbers**:
   All identified values \( a = 3 \), \( b = 13 \), and \( c = 2 \) are indeed prime numbers.

5. **Calculating the Product \( abc \)**:
   Now, we calculate the product:
   \[
   abc = 3 \times 13 \times 2
   \]
   Performing the multiplication:
   \[
   abc = 3 \times 13 = 39
   \]
   \[
   abc = 39 \times 2 = 78
   \]

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{78}
\]
