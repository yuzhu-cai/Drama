To solve the problem, we need to find a two-digit number based on the given conditions and then calculate the sum of that number and its reverse. Let's break down the solution step by step.

### Step 1: Set Up the Equations

1. **Sum of the digits**: Let the two-digit number be represented as \( n = 10a + b \), where \( a \) is the tens digit and \( b \) is the units digit. The first condition gives us:
   \[
   a + b = 13 \quad \text{(Equation 1)}
   \]

2. **Difference between the number and its reverse**: The reverse of the number is \( 10b + a \). The second condition gives us:
   \[
   (10a + b) - (10b + a) = 27
   \]
   Simplifying this, we have:
   \[
   9a - 9b = 27
   \]
   Dividing by 9, we get:
   \[
   a - b = 3 \quad \text{(Equation 2)}
   \]

### Step 2: Solve the System of Equations

Now we have a system of two equations:
1. \( a + b = 13 \)
2. \( a - b = 3 \)

We can solve these equations simultaneously.

**Adding the two equations**:
\[
(a + b) + (a - b) = 13 + 3
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
2a = 16 \implies a = 8
\]

**Substituting \( a \) back into Equation 1**:
\[
8 + b = 13 \implies b = 5
\]

### Step 3: Find the Original Number and Its Reverse

Now that we have \( a = 8 \) and \( b = 5 \), we can find the original number:
\[
n = 10a + b = 10(8) + 5 = 80 + 5 = 85
\]

The reverse of the number is:
\[
\text{Reversed}(n) = 10b + a = 10(5) + 8 = 50 + 8 = 58
\]

### Step 4: Calculate the Sum of the Original Number and Its Reverse

Now we can calculate the sum:
\[
\text{Sum} = n + \text{Reversed}(n) = 85 + 58 = 143
\]

### Conclusion

The sum of the original number \( 85 \) and the number with its digits reversed \( 58 \) is:

\[
\boxed{143}
\]

This solution addresses all aspects of the problem, confirming the conditions and providing the final result clearly and accurately.
