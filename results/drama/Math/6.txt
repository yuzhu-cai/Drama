To compute \( e^{\pi i} \), we can utilize Euler's formula, which is a fundamental equation in complex analysis. Euler's formula states:

\[
e^{ix} = \cos(x) + i\sin(x)
\]

where \( i \) is the imaginary unit and \( x \) is a real number. For our specific case, we will substitute \( x = \pi \):

\[
e^{\pi i} = \cos(\pi) + i\sin(\pi)
\]

Next, we need to evaluate the trigonometric functions \( \cos(\pi) \) and \( \sin(\pi) \):

- The value of \( \cos(\pi) \) is \( -1 \).
- The value of \( \sin(\pi) \) is \( 0 \).

Substituting these values back into the equation gives:

\[
e^{\pi i} = -1 + i \cdot 0
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
e^{\pi i} = -1
\]

Thus, the comprehensive solution to the original query is:

\[
\boxed{-1}
\]

This result is significant in mathematics, as it is a special case of Euler's identity, which states that \( e^{i\pi} + 1 = 0 \).
