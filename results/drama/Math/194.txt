To compute the binomial coefficient \(\binom{12}{9}\), we can use the formula for binomial coefficients:

\[
\binom{n}{k} = \frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}
\]

In this case, we have \(n = 12\) and \(k = 9\). We can also use the property of binomial coefficients that states \(\binom{n}{k} = \binom{n}{n-k}\). Therefore, we can rewrite \(\binom{12}{9}\) as:

\[
\binom{12}{9} = \binom{12}{3}
\]

This is beneficial because \(3\) is smaller than \(9\), making the calculations easier.

Now, we will compute \(\binom{12}{3}\):

\[
\binom{12}{3} = \frac{12!}{3!(12-3)!} = \frac{12!}{3! \cdot 9!}
\]

Next, we can express \(12!\) in terms of \(9!\):

\[
12! = 12 \times 11 \times 10 \times 9!
\]

Substituting this into our equation gives:

\[
\binom{12}{3} = \frac{12 \times 11 \times 10 \times 9!}{3! \cdot 9!}
\]

The \(9!\) in the numerator and denominator cancels out:

\[
\binom{12}{3} = \frac{12 \times 11 \times 10}{3!}
\]

Now we need to calculate \(3!\):

\[
3! = 3 \times 2 \times 1 = 6
\]

Substituting this back into our equation gives:

\[
\binom{12}{3} = \frac{12 \times 11 \times 10}{6}
\]

Now we can calculate the numerator:

\[
12 \times 11 = 132
\]
\[
132 \times 10 = 1320
\]

Now we divide by \(6\):

\[
\frac{1320}{6} = 220
\]

Thus, the value of the binomial coefficient \(\binom{12}{9}\) is:

\[
\boxed{220}
\]

This comprehensive solution clearly outlines the steps taken to compute the binomial coefficient, ensuring accuracy and clarity throughout the process.
