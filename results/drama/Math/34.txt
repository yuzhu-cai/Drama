To find the length of segment \( AC \) based on the provided information, we will follow these steps:

1. **Identify the Coordinates of Points A, B, and C**:
   - Point \( A \) is at the top left corner of the first square, which we can assign the coordinates \( A(0, 10) \).
   - Point \( B \) is at the bottom right corner of the second square, which is located at \( B(20, 0) \).
   - Point \( C \) is at the bottom right corner of the third square, which is at \( C(30, 0) \).

2. **Use the Distance Formula**:
   The distance formula to calculate the length of segment \( AC \) is given by:
   \[
   d = \sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2}
   \]
   Here, \( A(0, 10) \) and \( C(30, 0) \).

   Substituting the coordinates into the formula:
   \[
   AC = \sqrt{(30 - 0)^2 + (0 - 10)^2}
   \]
   \[
   = \sqrt{30^2 + (-10)^2}
   \]
   \[
   = \sqrt{900 + 100}
   \]
   \[
   = \sqrt{1000}
   \]

3. **Simplify the Radical**:
   We can simplify \( \sqrt{1000} \):
   \[
   \sqrt{1000} = \sqrt{100 \times 10} = \sqrt{100} \times \sqrt{10} = 10\sqrt{10}
   \]

4. **Final Answer**:
   Therefore, the length of segment \( AC \) is:
   \[
   \boxed{10\sqrt{10}} \text{ cm}
   \]

This solution clearly identifies the coordinates of the points, applies the distance formula correctly, and simplifies the result to provide the final answer in simplest radical form.
