To find the radius of a right circular cylinder given its lateral surface area and volume, we will use the formulas for lateral surface area and volume, and then solve the resulting equations.

### Given:
- Lateral Surface Area \( A = 3.5 \) square inches
- Volume \( V = 3.5 \) cubic inches

### Formulas:
1. **Lateral Surface Area**:
   \[
   A = 2\pi rh
   \]
2. **Volume**:
   \[
   V = \pi r^2 h
   \]

### Step 1: Express \( h \) in terms of \( r \)

From the lateral surface area formula, we can express \( h \) in terms of \( r \):
\[
h = \frac{A}{2\pi r}
\]
Substituting \( A = 3.5 \):
\[
h = \frac{3.5}{2\pi r}
\]

### Step 2: Substitute \( h \) into the Volume Formula

Now, we substitute this expression for \( h \) into the volume formula:
\[
V = \pi r^2 h
\]
Substituting \( V = 3.5 \) and \( h = \frac{3.5}{2\pi r} \):
\[
3.5 = \pi r^2 \left(\frac{3.5}{2\pi r}\right)
\]

### Step 3: Simplify the Equation

Now simplify the equation:
\[
3.5 = \frac{3.5 r^2}{2r}
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
3.5 = \frac{3.5 r}{2}
\]

### Step 4: Solve for \( r \)

To eliminate \( 3.5 \) from both sides, we can divide by \( 3.5 \):
\[
1 = \frac{r}{2}
\]
Multiplying both sides by \( 2 \):
\[
r = 2 \text{ inches}
\]

### Conclusion

The radius of the right circular cylinder is \( \boxed{2} \) inches.

### Verification

To ensure the solution is correct, we can verify by substituting \( r = 2 \) back into the formulas for lateral surface area and volume.

1. **Calculate \( h \)**:
   \[
   h = \frac{3.5}{2\pi(2)} = \frac{3.5}{4\pi} \approx 0.278 \text{ inches}
   \]

2. **Verify Lateral Surface Area**:
   \[
   A = 2\pi rh = 2\pi(2)\left(\frac{3.5}{4\pi}\right) = 3.5 \text{ square inches}
   \]

3. **Verify Volume**:
   \[
   V = \pi r^2 h = \pi(2^2)\left(\frac{3.5}{4\pi}\right) = \pi(4)\left(\frac{3.5}{4\pi}\right) = 3.5 \text{ cubic inches}
   \]

Both calculations confirm that the lateral surface area and volume match the given values. Thus, the solution is verified, and the radius is indeed \( \boxed{2} \) inches.
