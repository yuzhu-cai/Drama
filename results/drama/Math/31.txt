To determine how many four-digit positive integers can be formed where each digit is a prime number, we first identified the valid prime digits that can be used. The single-digit prime numbers are:

- 2
- 3
- 5
- 7

These digits are the only options available for constructing our four-digit integers.

### Steps to Calculate the Total Combinations:

1. **Identify the Digits**: The valid prime digits are 2, 3, 5, and 7.
2. **Determine the Number of Positions**: A four-digit integer has four positions: thousands, hundreds, tens, and units.
3. **Choices for Each Position**:
   - For the thousands place, we can choose any of the 4 prime digits (2, 3, 5, 7).
   - For the hundreds place, we can again choose any of the 4 prime digits.
   - For the tens place, we can choose any of the 4 prime digits.
   - For the units place, we can also choose any of the 4 prime digits.

Since the choice for each digit is independent, we multiply the number of choices for each digit:

\[
\text{Total combinations} = 4 \times 4 \times 4 \times 4 = 4^4
\]

Calculating \(4^4\):

\[
4^4 = 256
\]

### Conclusion:

Thus, the total number of four-digit positive integers where each digit is a prime number is **256**. This comprehensive solution addresses all aspects of the problem, confirming that each digit can be any of the identified prime digits and that the total combinations are calculated correctly.
