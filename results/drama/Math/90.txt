To find the intersection points of the parabolas defined by the equations \( y = x^2 + 4x + 6 \) and \( y = \frac{1}{2}x^2 + x + 6 \), we set the equations equal to each other:

\[
x^2 + 4x + 6 = \frac{1}{2}x^2 + x + 6
\]

Next, we rearrange the equation:

1. Subtract \( \frac{1}{2}x^2 \), \( x \), and \( 6 \) from both sides:

\[
x^2 - \frac{1}{2}x^2 + 4x - x + 6 - 6 = 0
\]

2. Simplify:

\[
\frac{1}{2}x^2 + 3x = 0
\]

3. Factor out \( x \):

\[
x\left(\frac{1}{2}x + 3\right) = 0
\]

Setting each factor equal to zero gives us the solutions:

1. \( x = 0 \)
2. \( \frac{1}{2}x + 3 = 0 \) leads to \( x = -6 \)

Now we have the x-values where the curves intersect: \( x = 0 \) and \( x = -6 \).

Next, we find the corresponding y-values for each x-value using either of the original equations. We'll use \( y = x^2 + 4x + 6 \):

1. For \( x = 0 \):

\[
y = 0^2 + 4(0) + 6 = 6
\]

So one intersection point is \( (0, 6) \).

2. For \( x = -6 \):

\[
y = (-6)^2 + 4(-6) + 6 = 36 - 24 + 6 = 18
\]

So the other intersection point is \( (-6, 18) \).

Thus, the intersection points are:

- \( (a, b) = (-6, 18) \)
- \( (c, d) = (0, 6) \)

Since \( c \ge a \), we have \( a = -6 \) and \( c = 0 \).

Finally, we compute the difference \( c - a \):

\[
c - a = 0 - (-6) = 0 + 6 = 6
\]

### Conclusion
The difference \( c - a \) is \( \boxed{6} \).
