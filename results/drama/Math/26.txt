To determine the greatest digit that can be placed in the circle of the six-digit number \( 3529\bigcirc2 \) so that the entire number is divisible by 4, we need to focus on the last two digits of the number, which are formed by the digit in the circle and the digit '2'.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Identify the Last Two Digits**: The last two digits of the number \( 3529\bigcirc2 \) will be \( \bigcirc2 \), where \( \bigcirc \) is the digit we are trying to determine.

2. **Form the Last Two-Digit Number**: The last two digits can be represented as \( x2 \), where \( x \) is the digit placed in the circle (ranging from 0 to 9).

3. **Check Divisibility by 4**: A number is divisible by 4 if the number formed by its last two digits is divisible by 4. Therefore, we need to check \( x2 \) for each digit \( x \) from 0 to 9.

4. **Testing Each Digit**:
   - For \( x = 0 \): \( 02 \div 4 = 0.5 \) (not divisible)
   - For \( x = 1 \): \( 12 \div 4 = 3 \) (divisible)
   - For \( x = 2 \): \( 22 \div 4 = 5.5 \) (not divisible)
   - For \( x = 3 \): \( 32 \div 4 = 8 \) (divisible)
   - For \( x = 4 \): \( 42 \div 4 = 10.5 \) (not divisible)
   - For \( x = 5 \): \( 52 \div 4 = 13 \) (divisible)
   - For \( x = 6 \): \( 62 \div 4 = 15.5 \) (not divisible)
   - For \( x = 7 \): \( 72 \div 4 = 18 \) (divisible)
   - For \( x = 8 \): \( 82 \div 4 = 20.5 \) (not divisible)
   - For \( x = 9 \): \( 92 \div 4 = 23 \) (divisible)

5. **List of Valid Digits**: The digits that make \( x2 \) divisible by 4 are:
   - \( 1 \) (12)
   - \( 3 \) (32)
   - \( 5 \) (52)
   - \( 7 \) (72)
   - \( 9 \) (92)

6. **Identify the Greatest Digit**: Among the valid digits \( 1, 3, 5, 7, 9 \), the greatest digit is **9**.

### Conclusion:
The greatest digit that can be placed in the circle of the six-digit number \( 3529\bigcirc2 \) to ensure that the entire number is divisible by 4 is **9**.
