To solve the equation \( |3 - 2i + w| = 0 \), we start by analyzing what it means for the absolute value of a complex number to equal zero. The absolute value of a complex number \( z \) is zero if and only if \( z \) itself is equal to zero.

Given the equation:

\[
|3 - 2i + w| = 0
\]

This implies that the expression inside the absolute value must be equal to zero:

\[
3 - 2i + w = 0
\]

Next, we can isolate \( w \) by rearranging the equation:

\[
w = - (3 - 2i)
\]

Now, simplifying this gives:

\[
w = -3 + 2i
\]

Thus, the value of \( w \) that satisfies the equation \( |3 - 2i + w| = 0 \) is:

\[
\boxed{-3 + 2i}
\]

This solution is clear and addresses all aspects of the problem, confirming that \( w = -3 + 2i \) is the correct and complete answer.
