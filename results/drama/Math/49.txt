To determine the length of the shadow of a 20-foot flagpole based on the information provided about a 6-foot woman and her shadow, we can use the concept of similar triangles.

### Given Information:
- Height of the woman (\( h_1 \)): 6 feet
- Length of the woman's shadow (\( s_1 \)): 9 feet
- Height of the flagpole (\( h_2 \)): 20 feet
- Length of the flagpole's shadow (\( s_2 \)): unknown

### Step 1: Establish the Ratio
Using the height of the woman and the length of her shadow, we can establish the ratio:
\[
\frac{h_1}{s_1} = \frac{6}{9}
\]

### Step 2: Simplify the Ratio
The ratio simplifies to:
\[
\frac{h_1}{s_1} = \frac{2}{3}
\]

### Step 3: Set Up the Equation for the Flagpole
Since the triangles formed by the flagpole and its shadow are similar to those formed by the woman and her shadow, we can set up the following equation:
\[
\frac{h_2}{s_2} = \frac{2}{3}
\]
Substituting the height of the flagpole:
\[
\frac{20}{s_2} = \frac{2}{3}
\]

### Step 4: Solve for \( s_2 \)
To find \( s_2 \), we can cross-multiply:
\[
2s_2 = 20 \cdot 3
\]
\[
2s_2 = 60
\]
Now, divide both sides by 2:
\[
s_2 = \frac{60}{2} = 30 \text{ feet}
\]

### Conclusion
The length of the shadow of the 20-foot flagpole is **30 feet**. This solution effectively uses the ratio derived from the woman's height and shadow length to find the corresponding shadow length of the flagpole, ensuring clarity and accuracy throughout the process.
