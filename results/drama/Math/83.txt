To find all possible values of the expression \( E = a^2 b + b^2 c + c^2 a \) where \( a, b, c \) are the roots of the polynomial 

\[
x^3 - 6x^2 + 3x + 1 = 0,
\]

we can utilize the properties of symmetric sums and the relationships between the roots and coefficients of the polynomial.

### Step 1: Identify the Roots and Their Relationships

From Vieta's formulas, for the polynomial \( x^3 - 6x^2 + 3x + 1 = 0 \), we have:

- \( a + b + c = 6 \)
- \( ab + bc + ca = 3 \)
- \( abc = -1 \)

### Step 2: Express \( E \) in Terms of Symmetric Sums

The expression \( E = a^2 b + b^2 c + c^2 a \) can be rewritten using the roots and their symmetric sums. We can factor \( E \) as follows:

\[
E = ab(a + b) + bc(b + c) + ca(c + a).
\]

However, a more straightforward approach is to use the identity:

\[
E = \frac{1}{2} \left( (a+b+c)(ab + ac + bc) - 3abc \right).
\]

### Step 3: Substitute the Values from Vieta's Formulas

Now, substituting the values from Vieta's formulas into the expression for \( E \):

1. \( a + b + c = 6 \)
2. \( ab + ac + bc = 3 \)
3. \( abc = -1 \)

Substituting these into the expression for \( E \):

\[
E = \frac{1}{2} \left( 6 \cdot 3 - 3(-1) \right)
\]

Calculating this gives:

\[
E = \frac{1}{2} \left( 18 + 3 \right) = \frac{1}{2} \cdot 21 = 10.5.
\]

### Conclusion

Thus, the only possible value of the expression \( a^2 b + b^2 c + c^2 a \) for the roots \( a, b, c \) of the polynomial \( x^3 - 6x^2 + 3x + 1 = 0 \) is:

\[
\boxed{10.5}.
\] 

This value is derived from the relationships established by Vieta's formulas and confirms that \( E \) has a unique value based on the roots of the given polynomial.
