To determine the total number of ways to set the 8 light switches so that either one or two banks of lights are on, we can combine the results from our previous calculations.

1. **Calculating the number of ways to choose 1 switch to be on:**
   - From our previous calculation, we found that there are **8 ways** to choose 1 switch to be on from the 8 switches.

2. **Calculating the number of ways to choose 2 switches to be on:**
   - From our previous calculation, we found that there are **28 ways** to choose 2 switches to be on from the 8 switches.

3. **Summing the results:**
   - To find the total number of ways to set the switches so that either one or two banks of lights are on, we add the two results together:

\[
\text{Total ways} = \text{Ways to choose 1 switch} + \text{Ways to choose 2 switches} = 8 + 28 = 36
\]

Thus, the total number of ways to set the 8 switches so that either one or two banks of lights are on is **36**.

In conclusion, the comprehensive solution to the original query is that there are **36 possible ways** to set the switches for the school dance.
