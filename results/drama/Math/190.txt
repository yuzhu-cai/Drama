To determine the probability of rolling the same number on both dice when rolling two fair, standard six-faced dice, we can follow these steps:

### Step 1: Identify the Total Number of Possible Outcomes

When rolling two six-faced dice, each die has 6 faces. The total number of possible outcomes can be calculated as follows:

\[
\text{Total outcomes} = 6 \times 6 = 36
\]

### Step 2: Identify the Favorable Outcomes

The favorable outcomes where both dice show the same number (also known as rolling doubles) are:

1. (1, 1)
2. (2, 2)
3. (3, 3)
4. (4, 4)
5. (5, 5)
6. (6, 6)

Thus, there are a total of **6 favorable outcomes**.

### Step 3: Calculate the Probability

The probability \( P \) of rolling the same number on both dice can be calculated using the formula:

\[
P(E) = \frac{\text{Number of favorable outcomes}}{\text{Total number of possible outcomes}}
\]

Substituting the values we found:

\[
P(\text{same number}) = \frac{6}{36}
\]

### Step 4: Simplify the Fraction

To simplify the fraction:

\[
P(\text{same number}) = \frac{6 \div 6}{36 \div 6} = \frac{1}{6}
\]

### Conclusion

The probability of rolling the same number on both dice when rolling two fair, standard six-faced dice is:

\[
\boxed{\frac{1}{6}}
\] 

This solution clearly outlines the steps taken to arrive at the final probability, ensuring that all aspects of the problem are addressed accurately.
