To find the area of triangle ABE based on the provided diagram and dimensions, we will follow these steps:

### Step 1: Identify the Coordinates of Points A, B, and E

From the diagram:

- Point A is at the origin: \( A(0, 0) \)
- Point B is 4 units to the right of A: \( B(4, 0) \)
- Point C is 5 units above A: \( C(0, 5) \)
- Point D is directly above B, 4 units up: \( D(4, 4) \)

Point E is the centroid of triangle ABD, which can be calculated as the average of the coordinates of points A, B, and D.

### Step 2: Calculate the Coordinates of Point E

The coordinates of point E can be calculated as follows:

\[
E = \left( \frac{x_A + x_B + x_D}{3}, \frac{y_A + y_B + y_D}{3} \right)
\]

Substituting the coordinates:

\[
E = \left( \frac{0 + 4 + 4}{3}, \frac{0 + 0 + 4}{3} \right) = \left( \frac{8}{3}, \frac{4}{3} \right)
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the Base and Height of Triangle ABE

- **Base (AB)**: The length of base AB is 4 units.
- **Height (from E to line AB)**: The height is the y-coordinate of point E, which is \( \frac{4}{3} \).

### Step 4: Calculate the Area of Triangle ABE

Using the area formula for a triangle:

\[
\text{Area} = 0.5 \times \text{base} \times \text{height}
\]

Substituting the values for the base and height:

\[
\text{Area} = 0.5 \times 4 \times \frac{4}{3} = \frac{8}{3}
\]

### Conclusion

The area of triangle ABE is:

\[
\boxed{\frac{8}{3}}
\]

This solution clearly outlines the steps taken to determine the area of triangle ABE, including the identification of coordinates, calculation of base and height, and application of the area formula.
