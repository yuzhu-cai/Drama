To find the minimum value of the function 

\[
f(a, b) = \frac{2}{a} + \frac{1}{b}
\]

subject to the constraint 

\[
a + 2b = 1,
\]

where \( a \) and \( b \) are positive real numbers, we will follow these steps:

### Step 1: Express \( b \) in terms of \( a \)

From the constraint \( a + 2b = 1 \), we can express \( b \) in terms of \( a \):

\[
b = \frac{1 - a}{2}.
\]

### Step 2: Substitute \( b \) into the function

Now we substitute this expression for \( b \) into the function \( f(a, b) \):

\[
f(a) = \frac{2}{a} + \frac{1}{\frac{1 - a}{2}} = \frac{2}{a} + \frac{2}{1 - a}.
\]

### Step 3: Differentiate \( f(a) \)

Next, we differentiate \( f(a) \) with respect to \( a \):

\[
f'(a) = -\frac{2}{a^2} + \frac{2}{(1 - a)^2}.
\]

### Step 4: Set the derivative to zero

To find the critical points, we set the derivative equal to zero:

\[
-\frac{2}{a^2} + \frac{2}{(1 - a)^2} = 0.
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
\frac{2}{(1 - a)^2} = \frac{2}{a^2}.
\]

Cross-multiplying gives:

\[
2a^2 = 2(1 - a)^2.
\]

Dividing both sides by 2:

\[
a^2 = (1 - a)^2.
\]

Expanding the right side:

\[
a^2 = 1 - 2a + a^2.
\]

Subtracting \( a^2 \) from both sides:

\[
0 = 1 - 2a.
\]

Solving for \( a \):

\[
2a = 1 \implies a = \frac{1}{2}.
\]

### Step 5: Find \( b \)

Now we can find \( b \) using the constraint:

\[
b = \frac{1 - a}{2} = \frac{1 - \frac{1}{2}}{2} = \frac{\frac{1}{2}}{2} = \frac{1}{4}.
\]

### Step 6: Evaluate \( f(a, b) \)

Now we evaluate \( f(a, b) \) at \( a = \frac{1}{2} \) and \( b = \frac{1}{4} \):

\[
f\left(\frac{1}{2}, \frac{1}{4}\right) = \frac{2}{\frac{1}{2}} + \frac{1}{\frac{1}{4}} = 4 + 4 = 8.
\]

### Step 7: Verify the constraint

We verify that the values satisfy the constraint:

\[
a + 2b = \frac{1}{2} + 2 \cdot \frac{1}{4} = \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{2} = 1.
\]

### Conclusion

Thus, the minimum value of 

\[
\frac{2}{a} + \frac{1}{b}
\]

subject to the constraint \( a + 2b = 1 \) is 

\[
\boxed{8}.
\] 

This value is achieved at \( a = \frac{1}{2} \) and \( b = \frac{1}{4} \).
