To determine how many numbers are in the list \( 6, 10, 14, \ldots, 82, 86 \), we can follow these steps:

### Step 1: Identify the First Term and Common Difference
From the given sequence:
- The **first term** \( a_1 \) is \( 6 \).
- The **common difference** \( d \) is \( 4 \) (since \( 10 - 6 = 4 \)).

### Step 2: Identify the Last Term
The **last term** \( a_n \) in the sequence is \( 86 \).

### Step 3: Use the Formula for the \( n \)-th Term
The formula for the \( n \)-th term of an arithmetic sequence is:

\[
a_n = a_1 + (n - 1) \cdot d
\]

We can rearrange this formula to solve for \( n \):

\[
n = \frac{a_n - a_1}{d} + 1
\]

### Step 4: Substitute the Values
Now we can substitute the known values into the rearranged formula:

- \( a_n = 86 \)
- \( a_1 = 6 \)
- \( d = 4 \)

Substituting these values gives:

\[
n = \frac{86 - 6}{4} + 1
\]

### Step 5: Calculate
1. Calculate \( 86 - 6 \):
   \[
   86 - 6 = 80
   \]

2. Divide by the common difference \( d \):
   \[
   \frac{80}{4} = 20
   \]

3. Add 1:
   \[
   20 + 1 = 21
   \]

### Conclusion
Thus, the total number of terms in the list \( 6, 10, 14, \ldots, 82, 86 \) is **21**.

This comprehensive solution confirms that there are **21 numbers** in the given arithmetic sequence.
