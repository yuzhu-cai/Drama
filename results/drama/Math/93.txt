To solve the problem, we need to determine which integer Marsha could have excluded from the first ten positive integers (1 through 10) such that the resulting sum is a perfect square.

### Step 1: Calculate the Total Sum of the First Ten Positive Integers

The sum of the first ten positive integers can be calculated using the formula:

\[
S_n = \frac{n(n + 1)}{2}
\]

For \( n = 10 \):

\[
S_{10} = \frac{10(10 + 1)}{2} = \frac{10 \times 11}{2} = 55
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the Possible Sums by Excluding Each Integer

Next, we will calculate the sums obtained by excluding each integer from 1 to 10:

1. **Excluding 1**: \( 55 - 1 = 54 \)
2. **Excluding 2**: \( 55 - 2 = 53 \)
3. **Excluding 3**: \( 55 - 3 = 52 \)
4. **Excluding 4**: \( 55 - 4 = 51 \)
5. **Excluding 5**: \( 55 - 5 = 50 \)
6. **Excluding 6**: \( 55 - 6 = 49 \)
7. **Excluding 7**: \( 55 - 7 = 48 \)
8. **Excluding 8**: \( 55 - 8 = 47 \)
9. **Excluding 9**: \( 55 - 9 = 46 \)
10. **Excluding 10**: \( 55 - 10 = 45 \)

The resulting sums are:

- 54
- 53
- 52
- 51
- 50
- 49
- 48
- 47
- 46
- 45

### Step 3: Identify Which Sums are Perfect Squares

Now, we will check which of these sums are perfect squares:

- \( 54 \) is not a perfect square.
- \( 53 \) is not a perfect square.
- \( 52 \) is not a perfect square.
- \( 51 \) is not a perfect square.
- \( 50 \) is not a perfect square.
- \( 49 = 7^2 \) (perfect square).
- \( 48 \) is not a perfect square.
- \( 47 \) is not a perfect square.
- \( 46 \) is not a perfect square.
- \( 45 \) is not a perfect square.

### Step 4: Determine Which Integer Was Excluded

The only sum that is a perfect square is \( 49 \). This sum was achieved by excluding the integer \( 6 \):

\[
55 - 6 = 49
\]

### Conclusion

Marsha did not include the integer **6** in her sum, resulting in a perfect square sum of \( 49 \).

Thus, the answer to the original query is:

**Marsha did not include the integer 6.**
