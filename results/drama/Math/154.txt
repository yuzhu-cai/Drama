To solve the original query of how many integers \( n \) satisfy both \( 0 < n < 60 \) and \( 4n \equiv 2 \mod{6} \), we can follow these steps:

### Step 1: Simplify the Congruence

We start with the congruence equation:
\[
4n \equiv 2 \mod{6}
\]

1. **Divide the entire equation by 2** (since 2 is a common factor):
   \[
   2n \equiv 1 \mod{3}
   \]

### Step 2: Solve the Simplified Congruence

Next, we need to find integers \( n \) such that:
\[
2n \equiv 1 \mod{3}
\]

To solve this, we can test values of \( n \):
- If \( n = 0 \): \( 2(0) \equiv 0 \mod{3} \)
- If \( n = 1 \): \( 2(1) \equiv 2 \mod{3} \)
- If \( n = 2 \): \( 2(2) \equiv 4 \equiv 1 \mod{3} \)

Thus, we find that:
\[
n \equiv 2 \mod{3}
\]

### Step 3: Write the General Solution

The general solution for \( n \) can be expressed as:
\[
n = 2 + 3k
\]
where \( k \) is any integer.

### Step 4: Determine Integer Solutions in the Range \( 0 < n < 60 \)

Now, we need to find the values of \( n \) that satisfy \( 0 < n < 60 \):
1. Substitute \( n = 2 + 3k \) into the inequality:
   \[
   0 < 2 + 3k < 60
   \]

2. **Solve the left side**:
   \[
   2 + 3k > 0 \implies 3k > -2 \implies k > -\frac{2}{3}
   \]
   Since \( k \) must be an integer, the smallest integer \( k \) can take is \( k = 0 \).

3. **Solve the right side**:
   \[
   2 + 3k < 60 \implies 3k < 58 \implies k < \frac{58}{3} \approx 19.33
   \]
   The largest integer \( k \) can take is \( k = 19 \).

### Step 5: Count the Integer Solutions

Now we have the range for \( k \):
\[
0 \leq k \leq 19
\]

The integer values of \( k \) are \( 0, 1, 2, \ldots, 19 \). This gives us:
\[
19 - 0 + 1 = 20
\]

### Conclusion

Thus, the total number of integer solutions \( n \) that satisfy both \( 0 < n < 60 \) and \( 4n \equiv 2 \mod{6} \) is \( \boxed{20} \).
