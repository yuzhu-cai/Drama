To solve the quadratic equation \( x^2 - 8x - 49 = 0 \) by completing the square and rewriting it in the form \( (ax + b)^2 + c \), we will follow these steps:

### Step 1: Rewrite the Equation
Start with the original equation:
\[
x^2 - 8x - 49 = 0
\]

### Step 2: Isolate the Constant Term
Move the constant term to the right side:
\[
x^2 - 8x = 49
\]

### Step 3: Complete the Square
To complete the square, we take the coefficient of \( x \) (which is \(-8\)), divide it by 2, and square it:
\[
\left(-\frac{8}{2}\right)^2 = (-4)^2 = 16
\]
Now, add and subtract this square inside the equation:
\[
x^2 - 8x + 16 - 16 = 49
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
(x - 4)^2 - 16 = 49
\]

### Step 4: Rearrange the Equation
Now, move \(-16\) to the right side:
\[
(x - 4)^2 = 49 + 16
\]
This gives:
\[
(x - 4)^2 = 65
\]

### Step 5: Write in Completed Square Form
Now, we can express the equation in the desired form:
\[
(x - 4)^2 - 65 = 0
\]
This can be rewritten as:
\[
(x - 4)^2 + (-65) = 0
\]

### Step 6: Identify Values of \( a \), \( b \), and \( c \)
From the completed square form \( (x - 4)^2 - 65 \):
- We can identify \( a = 1 \) (since the coefficient of the squared term is 1),
- \( b = -4 \) (the term inside the parentheses is \(-4\)),
- \( c = -65 \) (the constant term).

### Step 7: Calculate the Product \( ab \)
Now, we calculate the product \( ab \):
\[
ab = 1 \times (-4) = -4
\]

### Conclusion
Thus, the product \( ab \) is:
\[
\boxed{-4}
\] 

This solution clearly outlines the steps taken to complete the square, identifies the necessary values, and calculates the product accurately.
