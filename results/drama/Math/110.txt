To solve the problem, we have two distance equations based on the information provided:

1. **Distance to the park** (going there):
   \[
   \text{Distance} = 3x^2
   \]

2. **Distance back from the park** (coming back):
   \[
   \text{Distance} = 64 - 16x
   \]

Since the distance to the park and the distance back from the park are the same, we can set these two equations equal to each other:

\[
3x^2 = 64 - 16x
\]

Now, let's rearrange this equation to form a standard quadratic equation:

\[
3x^2 + 16x - 64 = 0
\]

Next, we will solve this quadratic equation using the quadratic formula, which is given by:

\[
x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}
\]

In our equation, \(a = 3\), \(b = 16\), and \(c = -64\). First, we need to calculate the discriminant \(b^2 - 4ac\):

\[
b^2 - 4ac = 16^2 - 4 \cdot 3 \cdot (-64)
\]
\[
= 256 + 768
\]
\[
= 1024
\]

Now, we can substitute the values into the quadratic formula:

\[
x = \frac{-16 \pm \sqrt{1024}}{2 \cdot 3}
\]
\[
= \frac{-16 \pm 32}{6}
\]

This gives us two potential solutions for \(x\):

1. 
\[
x = \frac{-16 + 32}{6} = \frac{16}{6} = \frac{8}{3}
\]

2. 
\[
x = \frac{-16 - 32}{6} = \frac{-48}{6} = -8
\]

Since we are given that \(x > 0\), we discard the negative solution. Thus, the only valid solution is:

\[
x = \frac{8}{3}
\]

### Conclusion
The value of \(x\) is:

\[
\boxed{\frac{8}{3}}
\]

This solution is clear and addresses all aspects of the problem, confirming that \(x\) is expressed as a common fraction. If you have any further questions or need additional assistance, feel free to ask!
