To add 313.9 and 12.6, you align the numbers by their decimal points:

```
  313.9
+  12.6
```

Now, add them column by column, starting from the right:

1. In the hundredths place: \(9 + 6 = 15\). Write down 5 and carry over 1.
2. In the tenths place: \(3 + 2 + 1 (carry) = 6\).
3. In the units place: \(3 + 1 = 4\).
4. In the hundreds place: \(3 + 0 = 3\).

Putting it all together, we get:

```
  313.9
+  12.6
-------
  326.5
```

Thus, the result of adding 313.9 and 12.6 is **326.5**.
