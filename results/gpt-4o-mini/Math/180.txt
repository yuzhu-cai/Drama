To determine how many five-digit zip codes exist such that each of the first three digits is greater than 4, we start by identifying the possible values for each digit.

The digits in a zip code can range from 0 to 9. For the first three digits, we want each digit to be greater than 4. The digits that satisfy this condition are 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9. Therefore, there are 5 possible choices for each of the first three digits.

For the last two digits of the zip code, there are no restrictions, meaning each of these digits can be any digit from 0 to 9. Thus, there are 10 possible choices for each of the last two digits.

Now, we can calculate the total number of valid five-digit zip codes by multiplying the number of choices for each digit:

1. For the first digit (greater than 4): 5 choices (5, 6, 7, 8, 9)
2. For the second digit (greater than 4): 5 choices (5, 6, 7, 8, 9)
3. For the third digit (greater than 4): 5 choices (5, 6, 7, 8, 9)
4. For the fourth digit (any digit): 10 choices (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9)
5. For the fifth digit (any digit): 10 choices (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9)

Now we multiply the number of choices together:

\[
\text{Total zip codes} = 5 \times 5 \times 5 \times 10 \times 10
\]

Calculating this step-by-step:

\[
5 \times 5 = 25
\]
\[
25 \times 5 = 125
\]
\[
125 \times 10 = 1250
\]
\[
1250 \times 10 = 12500
\]

Thus, the total number of five-digit zip codes where each of the first three digits is greater than 4 is 

\[
\boxed{12500}.
