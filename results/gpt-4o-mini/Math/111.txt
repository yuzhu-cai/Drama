To determine the values of \( n \) for which the quadratic equation \( 9x^2 + nx + 36 = 0 \) has exactly one solution, we need to analyze the discriminant of the quadratic equation. The discriminant \( D \) of a quadratic equation \( ax^2 + bx + c = 0 \) is given by the formula:

\[
D = b^2 - 4ac
\]

In our case, we have:

- \( a = 9 \)
- \( b = n \)
- \( c = 36 \)

Substituting these values into the discriminant formula, we get:

\[
D = n^2 - 4 \cdot 9 \cdot 36
\]

Calculating \( 4 \cdot 9 \cdot 36 \):

\[
4 \cdot 9 = 36
\]
\[
36 \cdot 36 = 1296
\]

Thus, the discriminant becomes:

\[
D = n^2 - 1296
\]

For the quadratic equation to have exactly one solution, the discriminant must be equal to zero:

\[
n^2 - 1296 = 0
\]

Solving for \( n^2 \):

\[
n^2 = 1296
\]

Taking the square root of both sides, we find:

\[
n = \sqrt{1296} \quad \text{or} \quad n = -\sqrt{1296}
\]

Calculating \( \sqrt{1296} \):

\[
\sqrt{1296} = 36
\]

Thus, the possible values for \( n \) are:

\[
n = 36 \quad \text{or} \quad n = -36
\]

Since we are asked for the positive value of \( n \), we conclude that:

\[
\boxed{36}
\]
