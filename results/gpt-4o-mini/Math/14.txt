To find the minimum value of the expression 

\[
E = \frac{\sec^4 \alpha}{\tan^2 \beta} + \frac{\sec^4 \beta}{\tan^2 \alpha},
\]

we start by rewriting the terms using the definitions of secant and tangent. Recall that 

\[
\sec^2 \theta = 1 + \tan^2 \theta.
\]

Thus, we have 

\[
\sec^4 \theta = (1 + \tan^2 \theta)^2 = 1 + 2\tan^2 \theta + \tan^4 \theta.
\]

Substituting this into our expression gives:

\[
E = \frac{1 + 2\tan^2 \alpha + \tan^4 \alpha}{\tan^2 \beta} + \frac{1 + 2\tan^2 \beta + \tan^4 \beta}{\tan^2 \alpha}.
\]

Let \( x = \tan^2 \alpha \) and \( y = \tan^2 \beta \). Then we can rewrite \( E \) as:

\[
E = \frac{1 + 2x + x^2}{y} + \frac{1 + 2y + y^2}{x}.
\]

To simplify our analysis, we can denote:

\[
f(x, y) = \frac{1 + 2x + x^2}{y} + \frac{1 + 2y + y^2}{x}.
\]

Next, we will apply the method of Lagrange multipliers or AM-GM inequality to find the minimum value of \( f(x, y) \). 

Using the AM-GM inequality, we can analyze each term separately. We have:

\[
\frac{1 + 2x + x^2}{y} + \frac{1 + 2y + y^2}{x} \geq 2\sqrt{\frac{(1 + 2x + x^2)(1 + 2y + y^2)}{xy}}.
\]

To find the minimum, we can assume \( x = y \). Let \( x = y = t \). Then,

\[
E = 2 \cdot \frac{1 + 2t + t^2}{t} = 2 \left( \frac{1}{t} + 2 + t \right) = \frac{2}{t} + 4 + 2t.
\]

To minimize \( \frac{2}{t} + 2t \), we can set \( u = t \) and find the derivative:

\[
g(u) = \frac{2}{u} + 2u.
\]

Calculating the derivative:

\[
g'(u) = -\frac{2}{u^2} + 2.
\]

Setting \( g'(u) = 0 \):

\[
-\frac{2}{u^2} + 2 = 0 \implies 2 = \frac{2}{u^2} \implies u^2 = 1 \implies u = 1.
\]

Now substituting \( u = 1 \) back into \( g(u) \):

\[
g(1) = \frac{2}{1} + 2 \cdot 1 = 2 + 2 = 4.
\]

Thus, 

\[
E = 2(4) = 8.
\]

To verify that this is indeed a minimum, we can check the second derivative:

\[
g''(u) = \frac{4}{u^3} > 0 \text{ for } u > 0.
\]

This indicates that \( g(u) \) is convex, confirming that \( u = 1 \) is a minimum point.

Therefore, the minimum value of the original expression is 

\[
\boxed{8}.
\]
