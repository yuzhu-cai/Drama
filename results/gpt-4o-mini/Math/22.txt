To find the probability that all four coins (a penny, a nickel, a dime, and a quarter) come up heads when flipped simultaneously, we can follow these steps:

1. **Determine the total number of outcomes for each coin flip**: Each coin has 2 possible outcomes: heads (H) or tails (T).

2. **Calculate the total number of outcomes for all four coins**: Since there are 4 coins and each can land in 2 ways, the total number of outcomes is given by:
   \[
   2^4 = 16
   \]

3. **Determine the number of favorable outcomes**: The only favorable outcome for our scenario (where all coins show heads) is the outcome where all four coins show heads (HHHH). Thus, there is only 1 favorable outcome.

4. **Calculate the probability**: The probability \( P \) of an event is given by the ratio of the number of favorable outcomes to the total number of outcomes:
   \[
   P(\text{all heads}) = \frac{\text{Number of favorable outcomes}}{\text{Total number of outcomes}} = \frac{1}{16}
   \]

Therefore, the probability that all four coins come up heads is \(\frac{1}{16}\).
