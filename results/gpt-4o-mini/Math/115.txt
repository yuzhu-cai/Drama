To solve for \( y \) in the system of equations given by

\[
4x - y + 2z = 7 \quad (1)
\]
\[
6x + 3y + 3z = 5 \quad (2)
\]

we can manipulate these equations to isolate \( y \).

First, we can express \( y \) from equation (1):

\[
-y = 7 - 4x - 2z
\]
\[
y = 4x + 2z - 7 \quad (3)
\]

Next, we will substitute equation (3) into equation (2). We first rewrite equation (2) using equation (3):

\[
6x + 3(4x + 2z - 7) + 3z = 5
\]

Now, we expand this equation:

\[
6x + 12x + 6z - 21 + 3z = 5
\]
\[
18x + 9z - 21 = 5
\]

Next, we add 21 to both sides:

\[
18x + 9z = 26
\]

Now, we can simplify this equation by dividing everything by 9:

\[
2x + z = \frac{26}{9}
\]

From this, we can express \( z \) in terms of \( x \):

\[
z = \frac{26}{9} - 2x \quad (4)
\]

Now we substitute equation (4) back into equation (3) to find \( y \):

\[
y = 4x + 2\left(\frac{26}{9} - 2x\right) - 7
\]

Expanding this gives:

\[
y = 4x + \frac{52}{9} - 4x - 7
\]

The \( 4x \) terms cancel out:

\[
y = \frac{52}{9} - 7
\]

To combine the terms, we convert \( 7 \) into a fraction with a denominator of 9:

\[
7 = \frac{63}{9}
\]

Thus,

\[
y = \frac{52}{9} - \frac{63}{9} = \frac{52 - 63}{9} = \frac{-11}{9}
\]

Therefore, the value of \( y \) is 

\[
\boxed{-\frac{11}{9}}.
\]
