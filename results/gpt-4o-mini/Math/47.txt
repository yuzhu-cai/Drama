To simplify the expression \(\frac{3a^2b}{5ac} \times \frac{10c}{6ab}\), we start by multiplying the two fractions together:

\[
\frac{3a^2b}{5ac} \times \frac{10c}{6ab} = \frac{3a^2b \cdot 10c}{5ac \cdot 6ab}
\]

Next, we can multiply the numerators and the denominators:

\[
= \frac{30a^2bc}{30abc^2}
\]

Now, we can simplify the fraction. First, we notice that \(30\) in the numerator and denominator cancels out:

\[
= \frac{a^2bc}{abc^2}
\]

Next, we can simplify the fraction further by canceling common factors in the numerator and the denominator. We have \(a\) in both the numerator and the denominator:

\[
= \frac{a^{2-1}bc}{bc^2} = \frac{abc}{bc^2}
\]

Now, we can cancel \(b\) from the numerator and denominator:

\[
= \frac{ac}{c^2}
\]

Finally, we can simplify \(c\) in the numerator and denominator:

\[
= \frac{a}{c}
\]

Thus, the simplified expression is:

\[
\boxed{\frac{a}{c}}
\]
