To find the probability that Morgan selects a shirt that is not a baseball shirt, we first need to determine the total number of shirts she has and the number of shirts that are not baseball shirts.

Morgan has the following shirts:
- Hockey shirts: 3
- Football shirts: 2
- Baseball shirts: 7

Now, we calculate the total number of shirts:

\[
\text{Total shirts} = \text{Hockey shirts} + \text{Football shirts} + \text{Baseball shirts} = 3 + 2 + 7 = 12
\]

Next, we find the number of shirts that are not baseball shirts. This includes the hockey and football shirts:

\[
\text{Shirts that are not baseball} = \text{Hockey shirts} + \text{Football shirts} = 3 + 2 = 5
\]

Now, we can calculate the probability that Morgan selects a shirt that is not a baseball shirt. The probability \( P \) is given by the ratio of the number of favorable outcomes (not baseball shirts) to the total number of outcomes (total shirts):

\[
P(\text{not a baseball shirt}) = \frac{\text{Number of shirts that are not baseball}}{\text{Total number of shirts}} = \frac{5}{12}
\]

Thus, the probability that Morgan randomly selects a shirt that is not a baseball shirt is 

\[
\boxed{\frac{5}{12}}.
\]
