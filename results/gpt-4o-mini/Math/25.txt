To solve the problem, we first need to determine the total number of cupcakes Ellen baked and the counts of cupcakes containing each ingredient.

Ellen baked \(2\) dozen cupcakes, which is:

\[
2 \times 12 = 24 \text{ cupcakes}
\]

Next, we denote:
- \(C\): the number of cupcakes containing chocolate
- \(R\): the number of cupcakes containing raisins
- \(CC\): the number of cupcakes containing chocolate chips
- \(N\): the number of cupcakes containing nuts

From the problem statement, we have:

\[
C = \frac{1}{2} \times 24 = 12
\]
\[
R = \frac{2}{3} \times 24 = 16
\]
\[
CC = \frac{1}{4} \times 24 = 6
\]
\[
N = \frac{1}{6} \times 24 = 4
\]

Now, we can summarize the counts:
- \(C = 12\)
- \(R = 16\)
- \(CC = 6\)
- \(N = 4\)

Next, we will use the principle of inclusion-exclusion to find the maximum number of cupcakes that could have none of these ingredients. We denote the total number of cupcakes with at least one ingredient as \(x\).

Using the principle of inclusion-exclusion, we have:

\[
x = C + R + CC + N - (C \cap R) - (C \cap CC) - (C \cap N) - (R \cap CC) - (R \cap N) - (CC \cap N) + (C \cap R \cap CC) + (C \cap R \cap N) + (C \cap CC \cap N) + (R \cap CC \cap N) - (C \cap R \cap CC \cap N)
\]

To maximize the number of cupcakes with none of these ingredients, we need to minimize \(x\). The maximum overlap of the ingredients will help us achieve this.

To find the maximum overlap, we can consider the total number of cupcakes with ingredients:

1. The maximum number of cupcakes that can contain all ingredients is limited by the smallest count of any ingredient. The smallest count is \(N = 4\).
2. Thus, we can assume that all \(4\) cupcakes containing nuts also contain chocolate, raisins, and chocolate chips.

This means we can have:

- \(C \cap R \cap CC \cap N = 4\)
- The remaining cupcakes with chocolate: \(C - 4 = 12 - 4 = 8\)
- The remaining cupcakes with raisins: \(R - 4 = 16 - 4 = 12\)
- The remaining cupcakes with chocolate chips: \(CC - 4 = 6 - 4 = 2\)

Now we can calculate the total number of cupcakes with at least one ingredient:

\[
x = 12 + 16 + 6 + 4 - 4 - 4 - 4 - 4 - 4 - 4 + 4 + 0 + 0 + 0 - 0
\]
\[
x = 12 + 16 + 6 + 4 - 12 + 4 = 30 - 12 = 18
\]

Thus, the number of cupcakes that had none of these ingredients is:

\[
24 - x = 24 - 18 = 6
\]

Therefore, the largest possible number of cupcakes that had none of these ingredients is:

\[
\boxed{6}
\]
