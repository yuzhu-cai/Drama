To find the 500,000th number in the sequence defined by the rules of listing and skipping, we first need to understand how the sequence is constructed.

1. **Pattern of Listing and Skipping**:
   - In the \(n\)th iteration, we list \(n + 3\) numbers and then skip \(n\) numbers.
   - The first few iterations are:
     - \(n = 1\): List 4 numbers (1, 2, 3, 4), skip 1 (5).
     - \(n = 2\): List 5 numbers (6, 7, 8, 9, 10), skip 2 (11, 12).
     - \(n = 3\): List 6 numbers (13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18), skip 3 (19, 20, 21).
     - \(n = 4\): List 7 numbers (22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28), skip 4 (29, 30, 31, 32).
     - And so on.

2. **Calculating the Total Numbers Listed and Skipped**:
   - For each \(n\), the total numbers processed (listed + skipped) is:
     \[
     (n + 3) + n = 2n + 3
     \]
   - The cumulative total after \(k\) iterations is:
     \[
     \sum_{n=1}^{k} (2n + 3) = 2\sum_{n=1}^{k} n + 3k = 2 \cdot \frac{k(k + 1)}{2} + 3k = k^2 + 5k
     \]

3. **Finding \(k\) such that \(k^2 + 5k \leq 500,000\)**:
   - We need to solve the inequality:
     \[
     k^2 + 5k - 500,000 \leq 0
     \]
   - Using the quadratic formula:
     \[
     k = \frac{-5 \pm \sqrt{5^2 + 4 \cdot 500,000}}{2} = \frac{-5 \pm \sqrt{25 + 2,000,000}}{2} = \frac{-5 \pm \sqrt{2,000,025}}{2}
     \]
   - Approximating \(\sqrt{2,000,025} \approx 1414.21\):
     \[
     k \approx \frac{-5 + 1414.21}{2} \approx 704.605
     \]
   - Thus, \(k\) can be at most 704.

4. **Calculating the Total Numbers for \(k = 704\)**:
   - For \(k = 704\):
     \[
     704^2 + 5 \cdot 704 = 496,816 + 3,520 = 500,336
     \]
   - For \(k = 703\):
     \[
     703^2 + 5 \cdot 703 = 494,209 + 3,515 = 497,724
     \]

5. **Determining the Position**:
   - After 703 iterations, we have listed 497,724 numbers.
   - The next iteration \(k = 704\) will list \(704 + 3 = 707\) numbers and skip 704 numbers.
   - The total numbers processed in this iteration will be:
     \[
     707 + 704 = 1,411
     \]
   - The numbers listed in this iteration will be from position 497,725 to position \(497,724 + 707 = 498,431\).

6. **Finding the 500,000th Number**:
   - The 500,000th number is in the next iteration \(k = 705\).
   - The numbers listed in this iteration will be \(705 + 3 = 708\) numbers, starting from position 498,432.
   - The total numbers processed in this iteration will be:
     \[
     708 + 705 = 1,413
     \]
   - The numbers listed in this iteration will be from position 498,432 to position \(498,432 + 708 - 1 = 499,139\).

7. **Continuing to the Next Iteration**:
   - The 500,000th number is the \(500,000 - 499,139 = 861\)th number in the \(k = 705\) iteration.
   - The first number in this iteration is \(499,140\) (the next number after 498,431).
   - The numbers listed will be \(499,140, 499,141, \ldots, 499,847\).

8. **Final Calculation**:
   - The 861th number in this iteration is:
     \[
     499,140 + 860 = 500,000
     \]

Thus, the 500,000th number in the sequence is \(\boxed{500000}\).
