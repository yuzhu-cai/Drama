To find the volume of the solid described, we need to consider the two components: a cylinder and a cone.

### Step 1: Volume of the Cylinder

The cylinder has a radius \( r = \sqrt{3} \) and a height \( h = 10 \). The formula for the volume \( V \) of a cylinder is given by:

\[
V = \pi r^2 h
\]

Substituting the values for the radius and height:

\[
V_{\text{cylinder}} = \pi (\sqrt{3})^2 (10) = \pi (3)(10) = 30\pi
\]

### Step 2: Volume of the Cone

The cone has the same radius \( r = \sqrt{3} \) and the same height \( h = 10 \). The formula for the volume \( V \) of a cone is given by:

\[
V = \frac{1}{3} \pi r^2 h
\]

Substituting the values for the radius and height:

\[
V_{\text{cone}} = \frac{1}{3} \pi (\sqrt{3})^2 (10) = \frac{1}{3} \pi (3)(10) = \frac{30\pi}{3} = 10\pi
\]

### Step 3: Total Volume of the Solid

The total volume of the solid is the sum of the volumes of the cylinder and the cone:

\[
V_{\text{total}} = V_{\text{cylinder}} + V_{\text{cone}} = 30\pi + 10\pi = 40\pi
\]

Thus, the volume of the solid in terms of \( \pi \) is:

\[
\boxed{40\pi}
\]
