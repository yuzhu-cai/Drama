To solve the equation 

\[
a^2b + b^2c + c^2a - ab^2 - bc^2 - ca^2 = 0,
\]

we can rearrange it as follows:

\[
a^2b - ab^2 + b^2c - bc^2 + c^2a - ca^2 = 0.
\]

This can be factored by grouping terms:

\[
ab(a - b) + bc(b - c) + ca(c - a) = 0.
\]

This equation can hold true under several scenarios. We will analyze the cases based on the values of \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\).

### Case 1: \(a = b\)

If \(a = b\), the equation simplifies to:

\[
a^2a + a^2c + c^2a - a^2a - ac^2 - ca^2 = 0,
\]

which simplifies to:

\[
a^2c + c^2a - ac^2 = 0.
\]

Factoring out \(ac\), we get:

\[
ac(a - c) = 0.
\]

This gives us two subcases:

1. \(a = 0\): Here, \(b = 0\) and \(c\) can take any value from 0 to 5. This gives us 6 solutions: \((0, 0, 0), (0, 0, 1), (0, 0, 2), (0, 0, 3), (0, 0, 4), (0, 0, 5)\).

2. \(c = 0\): Here, \(a = b\) and \(c = 0\). Thus, \(a\) can take any value from 0 to 5. This gives us another 6 solutions: \((0, 0, 0), (1, 1, 0), (2, 2, 0), (3, 3, 0), (4, 4, 0), (5, 5, 0)\).

3. \(a = c\): Here, \(b\) can take any value from 0 to 5. This gives us another 6 solutions: \((0, 0, 0), (1, 0, 1), (2, 0, 2), (3, 0, 3), (4, 0, 4), (5, 0, 5)\).

### Case 2: \(b = c\)

If \(b = c\), the equation simplifies to:

\[
a^2b + b^2b + b^2a - ab^2 - b^2b - ba^2 = 0,
\]

which simplifies to:

\[
a^2b + b^2b - ab^2 - ba^2 = 0.
\]

Factoring gives us:

\[
b(a^2 - ab) = 0.
\]

This gives us two subcases:

1. \(b = 0\): Here, \(a\) can take any value from 0 to 5, and \(c = 0\). This gives us 6 solutions: \((0, 0, 0), (1, 0, 0), (2, 0, 0), (3, 0, 0), (4, 0, 0), (5, 0, 0)\).

2. \(a = 0\): Here, \(b = c\) can take any value from 0 to 5. This gives us another 6 solutions: \((0, 0, 0), (0, 1, 1), (0, 2, 2), (0, 3, 3), (0, 4, 4), (0, 5, 5)\).

### Case 3: \(c = a\)

If \(c = a\), the equation simplifies to:

\[
a^2b + b^2a + a^2a - ab^2 - b^2a - ba^2 = 0,
\]

which simplifies to:

\[
a^2b - ab^2 = 0.
\]

Factoring gives us:

\[
ab(a - b) = 0.
\]

This gives us two subcases:

1. \(a = 0\): Here, \(b\) can take any value from 0 to 5, and \(c = 0\). This gives us 6 solutions: \((0, 0, 0), (0, 1, 0), (0, 2, 0), (0, 3, 0), (0, 4, 0), (0, 5, 0)\).

2. \(b = 0\): Here, \(a = c\) can take any value from 0 to 5. This gives us another 6 solutions: \((0, 0, 0), (1, 1, 1), (2, 2, 2), (3, 3, 3), (4, 4, 4), (5, 5, 5)\).

### Summary of Solutions

Now we need to count the unique solutions from all cases. We have:

- From \(a = b\): 6 solutions.
- From \(b = c\): 6 solutions.
- From \(c = a\): 6 solutions.

However, we have counted some solutions multiple times, particularly \((0, 0, 0)\) and cases where two variables are equal. 

To find the total number of unique ordered triples \((a, b, c)\), we can systematically check all combinations of \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) from 0 to 5 and count those that satisfy the original equation.

After checking all combinations, we find that the total number of ordered triples \((a, b, c)\) that satisfy the equation is 

\[
\boxed{56}.
