To find two positive whole numbers whose product is 2005 and neither of which is 1, we start by determining the prime factorization of 2005.

First, we check for divisibility by small prime numbers:

- **Divisibility by 2**: 2005 is odd, so it is not divisible by 2.
- **Divisibility by 3**: The sum of the digits \(2 + 0 + 0 + 5 = 7\) is not divisible by 3, so 2005 is not divisible by 3.
- **Divisibility by 5**: The last digit is 5, so 2005 is divisible by 5. We perform the division:
  \[
  2005 \div 5 = 401
  \]
  Thus, we have:
  \[
  2005 = 5 \times 401
  \]

Next, we need to check if 401 is a prime number. We check for divisibility by prime numbers up to the square root of 401 (approximately 20.02):

- **Divisibility by 2**: 401 is odd, so it is not divisible by 2.
- **Divisibility by 3**: The sum of the digits \(4 + 0 + 1 = 5\) is not divisible by 3.
- **Divisibility by 5**: The last digit is not 0 or 5, so it is not divisible by 5.
- **Divisibility by 7**: 
  \[
  401 \div 7 \approx 57.2857 \quad (\text{not an integer})
  \]
- **Divisibility by 11**: 
  \[
  401 \div 11 \approx 36.4545 \quad (\text{not an integer})
  \]
- **Divisibility by 13**: 
  \[
  401 \div 13 \approx 30.8462 \quad (\text{not an integer})
  \]
- **Divisibility by 17**: 
  \[
  401 \div 17 \approx 23.5882 \quad (\text{not an integer})
  \]
- **Divisibility by 19**: 
  \[
  401 \div 19 \approx 21.1053 \quad (\text{not an integer})
  \]

Since 401 is not divisible by any prime numbers up to its square root, we conclude that 401 is a prime number.

Thus, the only factorization of 2005 into two positive whole numbers (other than 1) is:
\[
2005 = 5 \times 401
\]

Now, we calculate the sum of these two numbers:
\[
5 + 401 = 406
\]

Therefore, the sum of the two numbers is \(\boxed{406}\).
