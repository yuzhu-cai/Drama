To find the greatest possible value of the greatest common divisor of two consecutive Fibonacci numbers, we denote the Fibonacci numbers as \( F_n \) where \( F_0 = 0 \), \( F_1 = 1 \), and \( F_n = F_{n-1} + F_{n-2} \) for \( n \geq 2 \).

We are interested in the greatest common divisor of two consecutive Fibonacci numbers, specifically \( \gcd(F_n, F_{n+1}) \).

Using the property of the Fibonacci sequence, we can derive the following:

\[
\gcd(F_n, F_{n+1}) = \gcd(F_n, F_{n+1} - F_n) = \gcd(F_n, F_{n-1}).
\]

This property can be applied recursively. Continuing this process, we find:

\[
\gcd(F_n, F_{n+1}) = \gcd(F_n, F_{n-1}) = \gcd(F_{n-1}, F_{n-2}) = \cdots = \gcd(F_1, F_0).
\]

Now, we compute \( \gcd(F_1, F_0) \):

\[
F_1 = 1, \quad F_0 = 0 \implies \gcd(F_1, F_0) = \gcd(1, 0) = 1.
\]

Thus, we conclude that:

\[
\gcd(F_n, F_{n+1}) = 1 \quad \text{for all } n \geq 1.
\]

To summarize, the greatest common divisor of any two consecutive Fibonacci numbers is always 1. Therefore, the greatest possible value of the greatest common divisor of two consecutive Fibonacci numbers is:

\[
\boxed{1}.
