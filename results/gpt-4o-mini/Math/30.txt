To find the sum of all integers \( n \) such that \( \frac{12}{n} \) is an integer, we need to determine the integers \( n \) that are divisors of 12. This means \( n \) must divide 12 without leaving a remainder.

First, we find the divisors of 12. The prime factorization of 12 is:

\[
12 = 2^2 \times 3^1
\]

To find the divisors, we can use the formula for the number of divisors based on the prime factorization. If \( n = p_1^{e_1} \times p_2^{e_2} \times \ldots \times p_k^{e_k} \), the number of divisors \( d(n) \) is given by:

\[
d(n) = (e_1 + 1)(e_2 + 1) \cdots (e_k + 1)
\]

For \( 12 = 2^2 \times 3^1 \):

\[
d(12) = (2 + 1)(1 + 1) = 3 \times 2 = 6
\]

Now, we can list the positive divisors of 12. The positive divisors are:

\[
1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 12
\]

Since \( n \) can also be negative, we include the negative divisors as well:

\[
-1, -2, -3, -4, -6, -12
\]

Thus, the complete set of divisors of 12 is:

\[
1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 12, -1, -2, -3, -4, -6, -12
\]

Next, we calculate the sum of all these divisors:

\[
1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 6 + 12 + (-1) + (-2) + (-3) + (-4) + (-6) + (-12)
\]

Grouping the positive and negative divisors:

\[
(1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 6 + 12) + (-1 - 2 - 3 - 4 - 6 - 12)
\]

Calculating the sum of the positive divisors:

\[
1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 6 + 12 = 28
\]

Calculating the sum of the negative divisors:

\[
-1 - 2 - 3 - 4 - 6 - 12 = -28
\]

Now, adding these two results together:

\[
28 + (-28) = 0
\]

Thus, the sum of all integers \( n \) such that \( \frac{12}{n} \) is also an integer is:

\[
\boxed{0}
\]
