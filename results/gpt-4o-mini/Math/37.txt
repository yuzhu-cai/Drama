To solve the problem, we first need to analyze the outcomes of each spinner and determine the conditions under which the product of the numbers from the two spinners results in a two-digit even number.

**Step 1: Identify the outcomes of each spinner.**

- Spinner I has sections labeled: \(2, 3, 4, 5\).
- Spinner II has sections labeled: \(1, 3, 5, 7, 9\).

**Step 2: Determine the total number of outcomes.**

The total number of outcomes when both spinners are spun is:
\[
4 \text{ (from Spinner I)} \times 5 \text{ (from Spinner II)} = 20 \text{ total outcomes.}
\]

**Step 3: Identify the conditions for the product to be a two-digit even number.**

A product is even if at least one of the factors is even. The even numbers from Spinner I are \(2\) and \(4\). The product must also be a two-digit number, which means it must be between \(10\) and \(99\).

**Step 4: Calculate the products for each even number from Spinner I.**

1. **When Spinner I shows \(2\):**
   - \(2 \times 1 = 2\) (not two-digit)
   - \(2 \times 3 = 6\) (not two-digit)
   - \(2 \times 5 = 10\) (two-digit, even)
   - \(2 \times 7 = 14\) (two-digit, even)
   - \(2 \times 9 = 18\) (two-digit, even)

   Valid products: \(10, 14, 18\) (3 outcomes)

2. **When Spinner I shows \(4\):**
   - \(4 \times 1 = 4\) (not two-digit)
   - \(4 \times 3 = 12\) (two-digit, even)
   - \(4 \times 5 = 20\) (two-digit, even)
   - \(4 \times 7 = 28\) (two-digit, even)
   - \(4 \times 9 = 36\) (two-digit, even)

   Valid products: \(12, 20, 28, 36\) (4 outcomes)

**Step 5: Count the total valid outcomes.**

Adding the valid outcomes from both cases:
- From \(2\): \(3\) outcomes
- From \(4\): \(4\) outcomes

Total valid outcomes = \(3 + 4 = 7\).

**Step 6: Calculate the probability.**

The probability that the product is a two-digit even number is given by the ratio of valid outcomes to total outcomes:
\[
\text{Probability} = \frac{\text{Number of valid outcomes}}{\text{Total outcomes}} = \frac{7}{20}.
\]

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{\frac{7}{20}}.
\]
