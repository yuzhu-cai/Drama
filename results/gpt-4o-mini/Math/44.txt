To solve the equation 

\[
\frac{x}{3} + \frac{x}{4} = 14,
\]

we first find a common denominator for the fractions on the left side. The denominators are 3 and 4, and the least common multiple of 3 and 4 is 12.

Next, we rewrite each fraction with the common denominator of 12:

\[
\frac{x}{3} = \frac{4x}{12} \quad \text{and} \quad \frac{x}{4} = \frac{3x}{12}.
\]

Substituting these into the equation gives:

\[
\frac{4x}{12} + \frac{3x}{12} = 14.
\]

Now, we can combine the fractions:

\[
\frac{4x + 3x}{12} = 14.
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
\frac{7x}{12} = 14.
\]

To eliminate the fraction, we multiply both sides of the equation by 12:

\[
7x = 14 \times 12.
\]

Calculating the right side:

\[
14 \times 12 = 168,
\]

so we have:

\[
7x = 168.
\]

Next, we solve for \(x\) by dividing both sides by 7:

\[
x = \frac{168}{7}.
\]

Calculating this gives:

\[
x = 24.
\]

Thus, the solution is 

\[
\boxed{24}.
\]
