To find how many four-digit positive integers can be formed where each digit is a prime number, we first identify the prime numbers less than 10, since we are dealing with digits. The prime numbers in this range are:

- 2
- 3
- 5
- 7

Thus, the available digits for our four-digit integers are 2, 3, 5, and 7.

Next, we need to consider the structure of a four-digit number. A four-digit number can be represented as \(abcd\), where \(a\), \(b\), \(c\), and \(d\) are the digits. The first digit \(a\) must be non-zero, but since all our digits are prime and non-zero, \(a\) can be any of the four prime digits (2, 3, 5, or 7).

Now, we can calculate the number of choices for each digit:

- For the first digit \(a\), we have 4 choices (2, 3, 5, 7).
- For the second digit \(b\), we also have 4 choices (2, 3, 5, 7).
- For the third digit \(c\), we again have 4 choices (2, 3, 5, 7).
- For the fourth digit \(d\), we have 4 choices (2, 3, 5, 7).

Since the choices for each digit are independent, we can find the total number of four-digit integers by multiplying the number of choices for each digit:

\[
\text{Total number of four-digit integers} = 4 \times 4 \times 4 \times 4 = 4^4
\]

Calculating \(4^4\):

\[
4^4 = 256
\]

Thus, the total number of four-digit positive integers where each digit is a prime number is \(\boxed{256}\).
