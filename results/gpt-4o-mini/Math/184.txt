To find the probability that Joe will get three hits in three at-bats, we can use the concept of independent events in probability.

Given that Joe's batting average is \(0.323\), the probability of him getting a hit in a single at-bat is:

\[
P(\text{hit}) = 0.323
\]

The probability of him not getting a hit in a single at-bat is:

\[
P(\text{no hit}) = 1 - P(\text{hit}) = 1 - 0.323 = 0.677
\]

Since we want to find the probability of Joe getting three hits in three at-bats, we can denote the probability of getting a hit in each at-bat as \(P(\text{hit})\).

The probability of getting three hits in three at-bats is calculated as follows:

\[
P(\text{3 hits in 3 at-bats}) = P(\text{hit}) \times P(\text{hit}) \times P(\text{hit}) = P(\text{hit})^3
\]

Substituting the value of \(P(\text{hit})\):

\[
P(\text{3 hits in 3 at-bats}) = (0.323)^3
\]

Now we calculate \(0.323^3\):

\[
0.323^3 = 0.323 \times 0.323 \times 0.323
\]

Calculating step-by-step:

1. First, calculate \(0.323 \times 0.323\):

\[
0.323 \times 0.323 = 0.104329
\]

2. Next, multiply the result by \(0.323\):

\[
0.104329 \times 0.323 \approx 0.033703
\]

Thus, the probability that Joe will get three hits in three at-bats is approximately \(0.033703\).

Finally, rounding this to the nearest hundredth:

\[
\text{Probability} \approx 0.03
\]

Therefore, the probability that Joe will get three hits in three at-bats is:

\[
\boxed{0.03}
\]
