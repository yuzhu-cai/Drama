To find the smallest positive multiple of 14 whose digits are all 1s and 0s, we denote this number as \( T \). Since \( T \) must be a multiple of 14, it must also be a multiple of both 2 and 7, since \( 14 = 2 \times 7 \).

### Step 1: Check for divisibility by 2
For \( T \) to be divisible by 2, it must end in an even digit. The only even digit available among the digits 1 and 0 is 0. Therefore, \( T \) must end with the digit 0.

### Step 2: Check for divisibility by 7
Next, we need to ensure that \( T \) is divisible by 7. Since \( T \) ends with 0, we can express \( T \) in the form \( T = k \times 10 \) for some integer \( k \) that consists of digits 1 and 0.

### Step 3: Finding \( k \)
We need \( k \) to be a number made up of the digits 1 and 0 such that \( T = k \times 10 \) is divisible by 14. This means \( k \) must be divisible by 7.

### Step 4: Generate candidates for \( k \)

### Step 5: Verify divisibility by 14
Now we check if \( 11111100 \) is divisible by 14:
- Check divisibility by 2: \( 11111100 \) ends in 0, so it is divisible by 2.
- Check divisibility by 7: 

Calculating \( 11111100 \div 7 \):
\[
11111100 \div 7 = 1587300
\]
This gives us an integer, confirming that \( 11111100 \) is divisible by 7.

### Step 6: Calculate the quotient
Finally, we calculate the quotient when \( T \) is divided by 14:
\[
T = 11111100
\]
\[
\frac{T}{14} = \frac{11111100}{14} = 793650
\]

Thus, the quotient when \( T \) is divided by 14 is \( \boxed{793650} \).
