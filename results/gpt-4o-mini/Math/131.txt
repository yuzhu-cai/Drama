To solve the equation 

\[
x^2 = -|x|,
\]

we start by analyzing the right-hand side, \(-|x|\). Since the absolute value \(|x|\) is always non-negative, \(-|x|\) is always non-positive. This means that the left-hand side, \(x^2\), which is always non-negative, can only equal \(-|x|\) if both sides are equal to zero.

Thus, we set both sides to zero:

\[
x^2 = 0 \quad \text{and} \quad -|x| = 0.
\]

From \(x^2 = 0\), we find:

\[
x = 0.
\]

Next, we check the condition \(-|x| = 0\):

\[
-|x| = 0 \implies |x| = 0 \implies x = 0.
\]

Since both conditions lead us to the same solution, we conclude that \(x = 0\) is a solution.

Now, we should verify if there are any other possible solutions. We can rewrite the original equation as:

\[
x^2 + |x| = 0.
\]

This equation consists of two parts: \(x^2\) (which is non-negative) and \(|x|\) (which is also non-negative). The sum of two non-negative terms can only be zero if both terms are zero. Therefore, we have:

1. \(x^2 = 0\) implies \(x = 0\),
2. \(|x| = 0\) also implies \(x = 0\).

Since both conditions lead to the same solution, we conclude that the only solution to the equation is 

\[
x = 0.
\]

Thus, the total number of solutions for \(x\) in the equation \(x^2 = -|x|\) is 

\[
\boxed{1}.
\]
