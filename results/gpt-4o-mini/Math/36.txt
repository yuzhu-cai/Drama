To find the positive difference between the greatest and least member of the set \(\left\{\frac{3}{7},\frac{4}{3},\frac{11}{8},\frac{6}{16}\right\}\), we first need to compare the fractions.

1. **Convert each fraction to a decimal for easier comparison:**
   - \(\frac{3}{7} \approx 0.4286\)
   - \(\frac{4}{3} \approx 1.3333\)
   - \(\frac{11}{8} = 1.375\)
   - \(\frac{6}{16} = \frac{3}{8} = 0.375\)

2. **List the decimal values:**
   - \(\frac{3}{7} \approx 0.4286\)
   - \(\frac{4}{3} \approx 1.3333\)
   - \(\frac{11}{8} = 1.375\)
   - \(\frac{6}{16} = 0.375\)

3. **Identify the greatest and least values:**
   - The least member is \(\frac{6}{16} = 0.375\).
   - The greatest member is \(\frac{4}{3} \approx 1.3333\).

4. **Calculate the positive difference:**
   \[
   \text{Difference} = \text{Greatest} - \text{Least} = \frac{4}{3} - \frac{6}{16}
   \]

5. **Convert \(\frac{6}{16}\) to a fraction with a common denominator:**
   - Simplifying \(\frac{6}{16}\) gives \(\frac{3}{8}\).
   - The least common multiple of the denominators \(3\) and \(8\) is \(24\).

6. **Convert both fractions to have a denominator of \(24\):**
   - \(\frac{4}{3} = \frac{4 \times 8}{3 \times 8} = \frac{32}{24}\)
   - \(\frac{3}{8} = \frac{3 \times 3}{8 \times 3} = \frac{9}{24}\)

7. **Subtract the two fractions:**
   \[
   \frac{32}{24} - \frac{9}{24} = \frac{32 - 9}{24} = \frac{23}{24}
   \]

Thus, the positive difference between the greatest and least member of the set is \(\boxed{\frac{23}{24}}\).
