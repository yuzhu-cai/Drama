Let the two consecutive positive even integers be \( x \) and \( x + 2 \). According to the problem, their product is given by:

\[
x(x + 2) = 288
\]

Expanding this equation, we have:

\[
x^2 + 2x = 288
\]

To form a standard quadratic equation, we can rearrange it:

\[
x^2 + 2x - 288 = 0
\]

Next, we will use the quadratic formula to solve for \( x \). The quadratic formula is given by:

\[
x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}
\]

In our equation, \( a = 1 \), \( b = 2 \), and \( c = -288 \). Plugging these values into the formula, we first calculate the discriminant:

\[
b^2 - 4ac = 2^2 - 4 \cdot 1 \cdot (-288) = 4 + 1152 = 1156
\]

Now we take the square root of the discriminant:

\[
\sqrt{1156} = 34
\]

Now we can substitute back into the quadratic formula:

\[
x = \frac{-2 \pm 34}{2}
\]

Calculating the two possible values for \( x \):

1. Using the positive root:

\[
x = \frac{-2 + 34}{2} = \frac{32}{2} = 16
\]

2. Using the negative root:

\[
x = \frac{-2 - 34}{2} = \frac{-36}{2} = -18
\]

Since we are looking for positive integers, we take \( x = 16 \). Therefore, the two consecutive positive even integers are:

\[
16 \quad \text{and} \quad 18
\]

The greater of the two integers is:

\[
\boxed{18}
\]

To verify, we can check the product:

\[
16 \times 18 = 288
\]

Thus, the solution is confirmed, and the greater integer is indeed \( \boxed{18} \).
