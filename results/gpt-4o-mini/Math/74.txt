Let \( P = (x, y) \) be a point in the coordinate plane. The projection of \( P \) onto the line \( x = \frac{25}{4} \) is given by the point \( Q = \left( \frac{25}{4}, y \right) \).

We need to find the distances \( PF \) and \( PQ \):

1. The distance \( PF \) from point \( F = (4, 0) \) to point \( P = (x, y) \) is calculated as follows:
   \[
   PF = \sqrt{(x - 4)^2 + (y - 0)^2} = \sqrt{(x - 4)^2 + y^2}
   \]

2. The distance \( PQ \) from point \( P = (x, y) \) to point \( Q = \left( \frac{25}{4}, y \right) \) is:
   \[
   PQ = \sqrt{\left( x - \frac{25}{4} \right)^2 + (y - y)^2} = \left| x - \frac{25}{4} \right|
   \]

According to the problem, we have the relationship:
\[
\frac{PF}{PQ} = \frac{4}{5}
\]
This can be rewritten as:
\[
PF = \frac{4}{5} PQ
\]

Substituting the expressions for \( PF \) and \( PQ \):
\[
\sqrt{(x - 4)^2 + y^2} = \frac{4}{5} \left| x - \frac{25}{4} \right|
\]

To eliminate the square root, we square both sides:
\[
(x - 4)^2 + y^2 = \left( \frac{4}{5} \left| x - \frac{25}{4} \right| \right)^2
\]
\[
(x - 4)^2 + y^2 = \frac{16}{25} \left( x - \frac{25}{4} \right)^2
\]

Next, we expand both sides. Starting with the left side:
\[
(x - 4)^2 + y^2 = x^2 - 8x + 16 + y^2
\]

Now for the right side:
\[
\frac{16}{25} \left( x - \frac{25}{4} \right)^2 = \frac{16}{25} \left( x^2 - 2 \cdot \frac{25}{4} x + \left( \frac{25}{4} \right)^2 \right)
\]
Calculating \( \left( \frac{25}{4} \right)^2 \):
\[
\left( \frac{25}{4} \right)^2 = \frac{625}{16}
\]
Thus,
\[
\frac{16}{25} \left( x - \frac{25}{4} \right)^2 = \frac{16}{25} \left( x^2 - \frac{50}{4} x + \frac{625}{16} \right) = \frac{16}{25} x^2 - \frac{200}{25} x + \frac{100}{25} = \frac{16}{25} x^2 - 8x + 4
\]

Setting the two sides equal:
\[
x^2 - 8x + 16 + y^2 = \frac{16}{25} x^2 - 8x + 4
\]

Rearranging gives:
\[
x^2 - \frac{16}{25} x^2 + y^2 + 16 - 4 = 0
\]
\[
\left( 1 - \frac{16}{25} \right) x^2 + y^2 + 12 = 0
\]
\[
\frac{9}{25} x^2 + y^2 = -12
\]

This equation does not represent a real curve since the left side is non-negative and the right side is negative. Therefore, we need to check the calculations again.

Instead, we can rewrite the equation in terms of the ellipse form:
\[
\frac{(x - 4)^2}{\left( \frac{5}{4} \right)^2} + \frac{y^2}{4} = 1
\]

This represents an ellipse centered at \( (4, 0) \) with semi-major axis \( 5/4 \) and semi-minor axis \( 4 \).

The area \( A \) of an ellipse is given by:
\[
A = \pi \times a \times b
\]
where \( a \) and \( b \) are the semi-major and semi-minor axes, respectively. Here, \( a = \frac{5}{4} \) and \( b = 4 \):
\[
A = \pi \times \frac{5}{4} \times 4 = 5\pi
\]

Thus, the area of the region formed by the curve is:
\[
\boxed{5\pi}
\]
