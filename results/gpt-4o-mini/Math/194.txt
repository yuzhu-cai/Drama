To compute \(\dbinom{12}{9}\), we can use the property of binomial coefficients that states:

\[
\dbinom{n}{k} = \dbinom{n}{n-k}
\]

In this case, we have \(n = 12\) and \(k = 9\). Therefore, we can rewrite the binomial coefficient as:

\[
\dbinom{12}{9} = \dbinom{12}{12-9} = \dbinom{12}{3}
\]

Now, we will compute \(\dbinom{12}{3}\) using the formula for binomial coefficients:

\[
\dbinom{n}{k} = \frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}
\]

Substituting \(n = 12\) and \(k = 3\):

\[
\dbinom{12}{3} = \frac{12!}{3!(12-3)!} = \frac{12!}{3! \cdot 9!}
\]

Next, we can simplify this expression. The factorial \(12!\) can be expressed as:

\[
12! = 12 \times 11 \times 10 \times 9!
\]

Thus, we have:

\[
\dbinom{12}{3} = \frac{12 \times 11 \times 10 \times 9!}{3! \cdot 9!}
\]

The \(9!\) in the numerator and denominator cancels out:

\[
\dbinom{12}{3} = \frac{12 \times 11 \times 10}{3!}
\]

Now, we compute \(3!\):

\[
3! = 3 \times 2 \times 1 = 6
\]

Substituting this back into our expression gives:

\[
\dbinom{12}{3} = \frac{12 \times 11 \times 10}{6}
\]

Now, we calculate the numerator:

\[
12 \times 11 = 132
\]
\[
132 \times 10 = 1320
\]

Now, we divide by \(6\):

\[
\dbinom{12}{3} = \frac{1320}{6} = 220
\]

Thus, we find:

\[
\dbinom{12}{9} = 220
\]

Therefore, the final answer is:

\[
\boxed{220}
\]
