To find the value of \( n \) for the point \( (1001, n) \) on the line shown in the graph, we first need to determine the equation of the line.

From the graph, we can identify two points through which the line passes. The endpoints of the line segment appear to be approximately at \( (-10, -2.71) \) and \( (10, 8.71) \).

Next, we calculate the slope \( m \) of the line using these two points:

\[
m = \frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1} = \frac{8.71 - (-2.71)}{10 - (-10)} = \frac{8.71 + 2.71}{10 + 10} = \frac{11.42}{20} = 0.571
\]

Now that we have the slope, we can use one of the points to find the equation of the line. Let's use the point \( (10, 8.71) \).

The point-slope form of the equation of a line is given by:

\[
y - y_1 = m(x - x_1)
\]

Substituting \( m = 0.571 \), \( x_1 = 10 \), and \( y_1 = 8.71 \):

\[
y - 8.71 = 0.571(x - 10)
\]

Now, we simplify this equation:

\[
y - 8.71 = 0.571x - 5.71
\]
\[
y = 0.571x + 3
\]

Now we have the equation of the line in slope-intercept form:

\[
y = 0.571x + 3
\]

Next, we need to find \( n \) when \( x = 1001 \):

\[
n = 0.571(1001) + 3
\]

Calculating \( 0.571 \times 1001 \):

\[
0.571 \times 1001 = 571.571
\]

Now adding 3:

\[
n = 571.571 + 3 = 574.571
\]

Thus, the value of \( n \) is:

\[
\boxed{574.571}
\]
