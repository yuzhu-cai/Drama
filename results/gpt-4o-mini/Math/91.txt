To find the value of \( f(3) \), we start with the function given by 

\[
f(x) = ax^4 - bx^2 + x + 5.
\]

We know that \( f(-3) = 2 \). We will first calculate \( f(-3) \):

\[
f(-3) = a(-3)^4 - b(-3)^2 + (-3) + 5.
\]

Calculating each term:

\[
(-3)^4 = 81, \quad (-3)^2 = 9,
\]

so we have:

\[
f(-3) = a \cdot 81 - b \cdot 9 - 3 + 5.
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
f(-3) = 81a - 9b + 2.
\]

Setting this equal to 2, we get:

\[
81a - 9b + 2 = 2.
\]

Subtracting 2 from both sides gives:

\[
81a - 9b = 0.
\]

This can be simplified to:

\[
9a - b = 0 \quad \text{or} \quad b = 9a.
\]

Next, we will calculate \( f(3) \):

\[
f(3) = a(3)^4 - b(3)^2 + 3 + 5.
\]

Calculating each term:

\[
(3)^4 = 81, \quad (3)^2 = 9,
\]

so we have:

\[
f(3) = a \cdot 81 - b \cdot 9 + 3 + 5.
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
f(3) = 81a - 9b + 8.
\]

Now, substituting \( b = 9a \) into the expression for \( f(3) \):

\[
f(3) = 81a - 9(9a) + 8.
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
f(3) = 81a - 81a + 8 = 8.
\]

Thus, the value of \( f(3) \) is 

\[
\boxed{8}.
\]
