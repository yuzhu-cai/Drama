To solve the problem, we need to determine the number of ways Liz can choose 3 marbles from her collection of 11 marbles, with the condition that she cannot choose both the green marble and the purple marble at the same time.

First, let's denote the total number of marbles as \( n = 11 \). We will denote the green marble as \( G \) and the purple marble as \( P \). The remaining marbles can be denoted as \( M_1, M_2, \ldots, M_9 \) (9 marbles that are neither green nor purple).

We will break down the problem into cases based on whether Liz chooses the green marble, the purple marble, or neither.

### Case 1: Liz chooses neither \( G \) nor \( P \)

In this case, Liz can choose all 3 marbles from the 9 remaining marbles \( M_1, M_2, \ldots, M_9 \). The number of ways to choose 3 marbles from 9 is given by the combination formula:

\[
\binom{9}{3} = \frac{9 \times 8 \times 7}{3 \times 2 \times 1} = 84
\]

### Case 2: Liz chooses \( G \) but not \( P \)

In this case, Liz has already chosen the green marble \( G \), so she needs to choose 2 more marbles from the remaining 9 marbles (which still includes \( P \)). The number of ways to choose 2 marbles from 9 is:

\[
\binom{9}{2} = \frac{9 \times 8}{2 \times 1} = 36
\]

### Case 3: Liz chooses \( P \) but not \( G \)

This case is similar to Case 2. If Liz chooses the purple marble \( P \), she also needs to choose 2 more marbles from the remaining 9 marbles (which still includes \( G \)). The number of ways to choose 2 marbles from 9 is again:

\[
\binom{9}{2} = 36
\]

### Total Count

Now, we can sum the number of ways from all three cases:

\[
\text{Total} = \text{Case 1} + \text{Case 2} + \text{Case 3} = 84 + 36 + 36 = 156
\]

Thus, the total number of ways Liz can choose 3 marbles, while adhering to her condition of not choosing both the green and purple marbles at the same time, is 

\[
\boxed{156}
\]
