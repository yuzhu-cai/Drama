The given list is an arithmetic sequence where the first term \( a = 6 \) and the common difference \( d = 4 \). We need to determine how many terms are in this sequence up to the last term \( 86 \).

The general formula for the \( n \)-th term of an arithmetic sequence is given by:

\[
a_n = a + (n-1)d
\]

Substituting the known values into the formula, we have:

\[
a_n = 6 + (n-1) \cdot 4
\]

We want to find \( n \) such that \( a_n = 86 \):

\[
86 = 6 + (n-1) \cdot 4
\]

To isolate \( (n-1) \cdot 4 \), we first subtract \( 6 \) from both sides:

\[
86 - 6 = (n-1) \cdot 4
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
80 = (n-1) \cdot 4
\]

Next, we divide both sides by \( 4 \):

\[
20 = n - 1
\]

Adding \( 1 \) to both sides gives:

\[
n = 21
\]

Thus, the total number of terms in the list is \( \boxed{21} \).
