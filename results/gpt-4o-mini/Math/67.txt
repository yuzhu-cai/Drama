Let the arithmetic sequence \( a_n \) be defined as 

\[
a_n = a + (n-1)d
\]

where \( a \) is the first term and \( d \) is the common difference. Let the geometric sequence \( b_n \) be defined as 

\[
b_n = b r^{n-1}
\]

where \( b \) is the first term and \( r \) is the common ratio. The sequence \( c_n \) is given by 

\[
c_n = a_n + b_n = a + (n-1)d + b r^{n-1}.
\]

We know the values of \( c_n \) for \( n = 1, 2, 3, 4 \):

\[
\begin{align*}
c_1 & = a + b = 1, \\
c_2 & = a + d + b r = 4, \\
c_3 & = a + 2d + b r^2 = 15, \\
c_4 & = a + 3d + b r^3 = 2.
\end{align*}
\]

We can set up a system of equations based on these values:

1. \( a + b = 1 \) (Equation 1)
2. \( a + d + b r = 4 \) (Equation 2)
3. \( a + 2d + b r^2 = 15 \) (Equation 3)
4. \( a + 3d + b r^3 = 2 \) (Equation 4)

From Equation 1, we can express \( b \) in terms of \( a \):

\[
b = 1 - a.
\]

Substituting \( b \) into the other equations:

**Substituting into Equation 2:**

\[
a + d + (1 - a) r = 4 \implies d + r - ar = 4 \implies d = 4 - r + ar.
\]

**Substituting into Equation 3:**

\[
a + 2d + (1 - a) r^2 = 15.
\]

Substituting \( d \):

\[
a + 2(4 - r + ar) + (1 - a) r^2 = 15 \implies a + 8 - 2r + 2ar + r^2 - ar = 15.
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
a + 8 - 2r + ar + r^2 = 15 \implies a + ar - 2r + r^2 = 7 \implies a(1 + r) - 2r + r^2 = 7. \tag{Equation 5}
\]

**Substituting into Equation 4:**

\[
a + 3d + (1 - a) r^3 = 2.
\]

Substituting \( d \):

\[
a + 3(4 - r + ar) + (1 - a) r^3 = 2 \implies a + 12 - 3r + 3ar + r^3 - ar^3 = 2.
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
a + 12 - 3r + 3ar + r^3 - ar^3 = 2 \implies a + 3ar - ar^3 - 3r + r^3 = -10 \implies a(1 + 3r - r^3) - 3r + r^3 = -10. \tag{Equation 6}
\]

Now we have two equations (Equation 5 and Equation 6) with \( a \) and \( r \). We can solve these equations simultaneously.

To find \( c_5 \):

\[
c_5 = a + 4d + b r^4.
\]

Using \( b = 1 - a \):

\[
c_5 = a + 4d + (1 - a) r^4 = a + 4d + r^4 - ar^4.
\]

We can express \( d \) in terms of \( a \) and \( r \) from Equation 2:

\[
d = 4 - r + ar.
\]

Substituting this into \( c_5 \):

\[
c_5 = a + 4(4 - r + ar) + r^4 - ar^4.
\]

Now we can compute \( c_5 \) using the known values of \( c_1, c_2, c_3, c_4 \):

Using the values we have:

1. \( c_1 = 1 \)
2. \( c_2 = 4 \)
3. \( c_3 = 15 \)
4. \( c_4 = 2 \)

We can observe a pattern or compute directly. 

To find \( c_5 \):

Using the differences:

\[
c_2 - c_1 = 3,
\]
\[
c_3 - c_2 = 11,
\]
\[
c_4 - c_3 = -13.
\]

The differences are \( 3, 11, -13 \). The second differences are \( 8, -24 \), which suggests a quadratic nature. 

To find \( c_5 \):

Using the differences, we can predict \( c_5 \):

\[
c_5 - c_4 = -13 + (11 - 3) = -13 + 8 = -5 \implies c_5 = 2 - 5 = -3.
\]

Thus, the value of \( c_5 \) is 

\[
\boxed{-3}.
