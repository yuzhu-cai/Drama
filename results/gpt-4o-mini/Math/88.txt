To find the range of the function 

\[
j(x) = \frac{5x + 3}{x},
\]

we can first simplify the expression. We can rewrite \( j(x) \) as follows:

\[
j(x) = \frac{5x}{x} + \frac{3}{x} = 5 + \frac{3}{x}.
\]

Next, we analyze the term \( \frac{3}{x} \). The function \( j(x) \) is defined for all \( x \neq 0 \). As \( x \) approaches 0 from the positive side, \( \frac{3}{x} \) approaches \( +\infty \), and as \( x \) approaches 0 from the negative side, \( \frac{3}{x} \) approaches \( -\infty \).

Now, let's consider the behavior of \( j(x) \) as \( x \) varies:

1. **As \( x \to \infty \)**: 
   \[
   j(x) = 5 + \frac{3}{x} \to 5 + 0 = 5.
   \]

2. **As \( x \to -\infty \)**: 
   \[
   j(x) = 5 + \frac{3}{x} \to 5 + 0 = 5.
   \]

3. **As \( x \to 0^+ \)** (approaching from the right):
   \[
   j(x) = 5 + \frac{3}{x} \to 5 + \infty = +\infty.
   \]

4. **As \( x \to 0^- \)** (approaching from the left):
   \[
   j(x) = 5 + \frac{3}{x} \to 5 - \infty = -\infty.
   \]

From this analysis, we see that \( j(x) \) can take on values from \( -\infty \) to \( +\infty \), but it approaches 5 from both sides as \( x \) goes to \( \pm \infty \).

To determine if \( j(x) \) can equal 5, we set the equation:

\[
5 + \frac{3}{x} = 5.
\]

Subtracting 5 from both sides gives:

\[
\frac{3}{x} = 0.
\]

This equation has no solution since \( \frac{3}{x} \) cannot be zero for any \( x \neq 0 \).

Thus, the function \( j(x) \) approaches 5 but never actually reaches it. Therefore, the range of the function is all real numbers except 5.

In interval notation, the range of \( j(x) \) is:

\[
\boxed{(-\infty, 5) \cup (5, \infty)}.
\]
