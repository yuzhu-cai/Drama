To find \(5\%\) of \(10\%\) of \(1200\), we can break the problem down into two steps.

First, we calculate \(10\%\) of \(1200\):

\[
10\% \text{ of } 1200 = \frac{10}{100} \times 1200 = 0.1 \times 1200 = 120
\]

Next, we need to find \(5\%\) of the result we just calculated, which is \(120\):

\[
5\% \text{ of } 120 = \frac{5}{100} \times 120 = 0.05 \times 120 = 6
\]

Thus, \(5\%\) of \(10\%\) of \(1200\) is 

\[
\boxed{6}
\]
