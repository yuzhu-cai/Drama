Let the two-digit number be represented as \( 10a + b \), where \( a \) is the tens digit and \( b \) is the units digit. We are given two conditions:

1. The sum of the digits is \( 13 \):
   \[
   a + b = 13
   \]

2. The difference between the number and the number with its digits reversed is \( 27 \):
   \[
   (10a + b) - (10b + a) = 27
   \]

We can simplify the second equation:
\[
10a + b - 10b - a = 27
\]
\[
9a - 9b = 27
\]
Dividing both sides by \( 9 \):
\[
a - b = 3
\]

Now we have a system of equations:
1. \( a + b = 13 \)
2. \( a - b = 3 \)

We can solve this system by adding the two equations:
\[
(a + b) + (a - b) = 13 + 3
\]
\[
2a = 16
\]
\[
a = 8
\]

Substituting \( a = 8 \) back into the first equation:
\[
8 + b = 13
\]
\[
b = 5
\]

Thus, the original number is:
\[
10a + b = 10 \cdot 8 + 5 = 80 + 5 = 85
\]

Next, we find the number with its digits reversed:
\[
10b + a = 10 \cdot 5 + 8 = 50 + 8 = 58
\]

Now, we need to find the sum of the original number and the number with its digits reversed:
\[
85 + 58 = 143
\]

Finally, we verify the conditions:
- The sum of the digits \( 8 + 5 = 13 \) is correct.
- The difference \( 85 - 58 = 27 \) is also correct.

Thus, the sum of the original number and the number with its digits reversed is:
\[
\boxed{143}
\]
