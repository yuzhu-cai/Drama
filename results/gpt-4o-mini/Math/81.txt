To find the value of \( k \) such that the remainder when \( kx^4 + 9x^3 + kx^2 + 32x - 11 \) is divided by \( x + 5 \) is \( 4 \), we can use the Remainder Theorem. According to the theorem, the remainder of a polynomial \( f(x) \) when divided by \( x - r \) is \( f(r) \).

In this case, we need to evaluate the polynomial at \( x = -5 \):

\[
f(x) = kx^4 + 9x^3 + kx^2 + 32x - 11
\]

Substituting \( x = -5 \):

\[
f(-5) = k(-5)^4 + 9(-5)^3 + k(-5)^2 + 32(-5) - 11
\]

Calculating each term:

1. \( k(-5)^4 = k \cdot 625 = 625k \)
2. \( 9(-5)^3 = 9 \cdot (-125) = -1125 \)
3. \( k(-5)^2 = k \cdot 25 = 25k \)
4. \( 32(-5) = -160 \)
5. The constant term is \( -11 \).

Putting it all together:

\[
f(-5) = 625k - 1125 + 25k - 160 - 11
\]

Combining like terms:

\[
f(-5) = (625k + 25k) + (-1125 - 160 - 11)
\]
\[
= 650k - 1296
\]

According to the problem, we know that \( f(-5) = 4 \):

\[
650k - 1296 = 4
\]

Now, we solve for \( k \):

\[
650k = 4 + 1296
\]
\[
650k = 1300
\]
\[
k = \frac{1300}{650} = 2
\]

Thus, the value of \( k \) is 

\[
\boxed{2}
\]
