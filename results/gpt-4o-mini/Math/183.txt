To find the greatest common factor (GCF) of \(5!\), \(10!\), and \(15!\), we first need to understand the factorial notation. The factorial of a number \(n\), denoted as \(n!\), is the product of all positive integers from \(1\) to \(n\).

Calculating the factorials:

\[
5! = 5 \times 4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1 = 120
\]

\[
10! = 10 \times 9 \times 8 \times 7 \times 6 \times 5 \times 4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1
\]

\[
15! = 15 \times 14 \times 13 \times 12 \times 11 \times 10 \times 9 \times 8 \times 7 \times 6 \times 5 \times 4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1
\]

Next, we note that \(n!\) for any \(n\) includes all the factorials of the numbers less than \(n\). Specifically, we have:

\[
10! = 10 \times 9 \times 8 \times 7 \times 6 \times 5!
\]

\[
15! = 15 \times 14 \times 13 \times 12 \times 11 \times 10!
\]

From this, we can see that \(5!\) is a factor of both \(10!\) and \(15!\). Therefore, the GCF of \(5!\), \(10!\), and \(15!\) must be \(5!\).

To confirm, we can observe that:

- \(5!\) is a factor of \(10!\) because \(10!\) contains \(5!\) as part of its product.
- \(5!\) is also a factor of \(15!\) for the same reason.

Since \(5!\) is the largest factorial that divides both \(10!\) and \(15!\), we conclude that the GCF of \(5!\), \(10!\), and \(15!\) is indeed \(5!\).

Thus, the greatest common factor is:

\[
\boxed{120}
\]
