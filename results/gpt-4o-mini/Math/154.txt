To solve the problem, we start with the congruence given:

\[
4n \equiv 2 \pmod{6}
\]

We can simplify this congruence. First, we can divide both sides of the congruence by 2 (since 2 is a common factor of both sides and does not affect the modulo operation):

\[
2n \equiv 1 \pmod{3}
\]

Next, we need to find integers \( n \) that satisfy this new congruence. To do this, we can test values of \( n \) modulo 3:

- If \( n \equiv 0 \pmod{3} \), then \( 2n \equiv 0 \pmod{3} \).
- If \( n \equiv 1 \pmod{3} \), then \( 2n \equiv 2 \pmod{3} \).
- If \( n \equiv 2 \pmod{3} \), then \( 2n \equiv 1 \pmod{3} \).

From this, we see that \( n \equiv 2 \pmod{3} \) is the only case that satisfies \( 2n \equiv 1 \pmod{3} \).

Next, we express \( n \) in terms of \( k \) where \( k \) is an integer:

\[
n = 3k + 2
\]

Now, we need to find the integers \( n \) that satisfy the condition \( 0 < n < 60 \). Substituting our expression for \( n \):

\[
0 < 3k + 2 < 60
\]

We can break this into two inequalities:

1. \( 3k + 2 > 0 \)
2. \( 3k + 2 < 60 \)

Starting with the first inequality:

\[
3k + 2 > 0 \implies 3k > -2 \implies k > -\frac{2}{3}
\]

Since \( k \) must be an integer, the smallest integer satisfying this is \( k \geq 0 \).

Now, for the second inequality:

\[
3k + 2 < 60 \implies 3k < 58 \implies k < \frac{58}{3} \approx 19.33
\]

Thus, the largest integer \( k \) can take is \( k \leq 19 \).

Now we have the range for \( k \):

\[
0 \leq k \leq 19
\]

The integers \( k \) can take are \( 0, 1, 2, \ldots, 19 \). This gives us a total of:

\[
19 - 0 + 1 = 20
\]

Thus, the number of integers \( n \) that satisfy \( 0 < n < 60 \) and \( 4n \equiv 2 \pmod{6} \) is:

\[
\boxed{20}
\]
