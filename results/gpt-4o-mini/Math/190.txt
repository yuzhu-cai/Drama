To find the probability of rolling the same number on both dice when rolling two fair six-sided dice, we first determine the total number of possible outcomes when rolling the two dice.

Each die has 6 faces, so when rolling two dice, the total number of outcomes is:

\[
6 \times 6 = 36
\]

Next, we need to count the number of favorable outcomes where both dice show the same number. The possible pairs where the numbers are the same are:

- (1, 1)
- (2, 2)
- (3, 3)
- (4, 4)
- (5, 5)
- (6, 6)

There are 6 favorable outcomes in total.

Now, we can calculate the probability of rolling the same number on both dice by dividing the number of favorable outcomes by the total number of outcomes:

\[
\text{Probability} = \frac{\text{Number of favorable outcomes}}{\text{Total number of outcomes}} = \frac{6}{36}
\]

We can simplify this fraction:

\[
\frac{6}{36} = \frac{1}{6}
\]

Thus, the probability of rolling the same number on both dice is:

\[
\boxed{\frac{1}{6}}
\]
