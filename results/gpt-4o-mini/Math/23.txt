To solve the expression 

\[
\frac{7+21}{14+42},
\]

we first simplify the numerator and the denominator separately.

Starting with the numerator:

\[
7 + 21 = 28.
\]

Next, we simplify the denominator:

\[
14 + 42 = 56.
\]

Now we can rewrite the expression with the simplified values:

\[
\frac{28}{56}.
\]

Next, we simplify the fraction \(\frac{28}{56}\). We can do this by finding the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 28 and 56. The GCD is 28, so we divide both the numerator and the denominator by 28:

\[
\frac{28 \div 28}{56 \div 28} = \frac{1}{2}.
\]

Thus, the value of the original expression is 

\[
\boxed{\frac{1}{2}}.
\]
