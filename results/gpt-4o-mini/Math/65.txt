Given the equation 

\[
x - \frac{1}{x} = 3,
\]

we want to find \( x + \frac{1}{x} \). Let's denote 

\[
y = x + \frac{1}{x}.
\]

We can relate \( y \) to the given equation by squaring both \( y \) and the original equation. First, we square \( y \):

\[
y^2 = \left( x + \frac{1}{x} \right)^2 = x^2 + 2 + \frac{1}{x^2}.
\]

Next, we also square the original equation:

\[
x - \frac{1}{x} = 3 \implies \left( x - \frac{1}{x} \right)^2 = 3^2 = 9.
\]

Expanding the left side gives:

\[
x^2 - 2 + \frac{1}{x^2} = 9.
\]

Rearranging this, we find:

\[
x^2 + \frac{1}{x^2} = 9 + 2 = 11.
\]

Now we have two expressions:

1. \( y^2 = x^2 + 2 + \frac{1}{x^2} = x^2 + \frac{1}{x^2} + 2 \)
2. \( x^2 + \frac{1}{x^2} = 11 \)

Substituting the second expression into the first gives:

\[
y^2 = 11 + 2 = 13.
\]

Thus, we have:

\[
y^2 = 13.
\]

Taking the square root of both sides, we find:

\[
y = \sqrt{13} \quad \text{(since \( x \) is positive, \( y \) must also be positive)}.
\]

Therefore, the value of \( x + \frac{1}{x} \) is 

\[
\boxed{\sqrt{13}}.
\]
