Given that the arithmetic mean of \( x \) and \( y \) is 7, we have:

\[
\frac{x+y}{2} = 7
\]

Multiplying both sides by 2 gives:

\[
x + y = 14
\]

Next, we know that the geometric mean of \( x \) and \( y \) is \( \sqrt{19} \):

\[
\sqrt{xy} = \sqrt{19}
\]

Squaring both sides yields:

\[
xy = 19
\]

Now we have a system of equations:

1. \( x + y = 14 \)
2. \( xy = 19 \)

We can use these equations to find \( x^2 + y^2 \). We know that:

\[
x^2 + y^2 = (x+y)^2 - 2xy
\]

Substituting the values we have:

\[
x^2 + y^2 = (14)^2 - 2(19)
\]

Calculating \( (14)^2 \):

\[
(14)^2 = 196
\]

Calculating \( 2(19) \):

\[
2(19) = 38
\]

Now substituting these values into the equation for \( x^2 + y^2 \):

\[
x^2 + y^2 = 196 - 38 = 158
\]

Thus, the value of \( x^2 + y^2 \) is:

\[
\boxed{158}
\]
