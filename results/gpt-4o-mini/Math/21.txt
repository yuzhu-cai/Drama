To determine the values of \( n \) such that the number \( 42{,}789{,}n37 \) is divisible by 3, we need to use the rule that a number is divisible by 3 if the sum of its digits is divisible by 3.

First, we calculate the sum of the known digits in \( 42{,}789{,}n37 \):

\[
4 + 2 + 7 + 8 + 9 + n + 3 + 7
\]

Calculating the sum of the digits without \( n \):

\[
4 + 2 = 6
\]
\[
6 + 7 = 13
\]
\[
13 + 8 = 21
\]
\[
21 + 9 = 30
\]
\[
30 + 3 = 33
\]
\[
33 + 7 = 40
\]

Thus, the sum of the digits is:

\[
40 + n
\]

Next, we want \( 40 + n \) to be divisible by 3. To find the values of \( n \) that satisfy this condition, we first find \( 40 \mod 3 \):

\[
40 \div 3 = 13 \quad \text{(remainder 1)}
\]
Thus, \( 40 \equiv 1 \mod 3 \).

Now, we need:

\[
40 + n \equiv 0 \mod 3
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
1 + n \equiv 0 \mod 3
\]
\[
n \equiv -1 \equiv 2 \mod 3
\]

The single-digit values of \( n \) that satisfy \( n \equiv 2 \mod 3 \) are:

- \( n = 2 \)
- \( n = 5 \)
- \( n = 8 \)

Now, we will sum these valid values of \( n \):

\[
2 + 5 + 8 = 15
\]

Thus, the sum of all single-digit replacements for \( n \) such that the number \( 42{,}789{,}n37 \) is divisible by 3 is:

\[
\boxed{15}
\]
