To determine which point is farthest from the origin, we need to calculate the distance of each point from the origin \((0,0)\). The distance \(d\) from a point \((x,y)\) to the origin is given by the formula:

\[
d = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2}
\]

We will calculate the distance for each of the given points.

1. For the point \((1,4)\):
   \[
   d = \sqrt{1^2 + 4^2} = \sqrt{1 + 16} = \sqrt{17}
   \]

2. For the point \((3,5)\):
   \[
   d = \sqrt{3^2 + 5^2} = \sqrt{9 + 25} = \sqrt{34}
   \]

3. For the point \((-6,0)\):
   \[
   d = \sqrt{(-6)^2 + 0^2} = \sqrt{36 + 0} = \sqrt{36} = 6
   \]

4. For the point \((-4,-2)\):
   \[
   d = \sqrt{(-4)^2 + (-2)^2} = \sqrt{16 + 4} = \sqrt{20} = 2\sqrt{5}
   \]

Now we will compare the distances:

- Distance from \((1,4)\) is \(\sqrt{17}\).
- Distance from \((3,5)\) is \(\sqrt{34}\).
- Distance from \((-6,0)\) is \(6\).
- Distance from \((-4,-2)\) is \(2\sqrt{5}\).

Next, we will approximate the square roots to compare them more easily:

- \(\sqrt{17} \approx 4.123\)
- \(\sqrt{34} \approx 5.831\)
- \(6\) is \(6\).
- \(2\sqrt{5} \approx 2 \times 2.236 = 4.472\)

Now we can see the approximate distances:

- \(\sqrt{17} \approx 4.123\)
- \(\sqrt{34} \approx 5.831\)
- \(6\)
- \(2\sqrt{5} \approx 4.472\)

The largest distance is \(6\) from the point \((-6,0)\).

Thus, the point that is farthest from the origin is 

\[
\boxed{(-6,0)}
\]
