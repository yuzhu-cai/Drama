To solve for \( x \) in the given diagram, we start by analyzing the angles formed by the lines \( PRT \) and \( QRS \).

1. **Identify the angles**:
   - The angle at point \( Q \) is given as \( 40^\circ \).
   - The angle at point \( T \) is labeled as \( x^\circ \).

2. **Use the property of straight lines**:
   Since \( PRT \) and \( QRS \) are straight lines, we know that the angles on a straight line sum up to \( 180^\circ \). Therefore, we can write the equation:

   \[
   x + 40^\circ = 180^\circ
   \]

3. **Solve for \( x \)**:
   To find \( x \), we rearrange the equation:

   \[
   x = 180^\circ - 40^\circ
   \]

   \[
   x = 140^\circ
   \]

Thus, the value of \( x \) is 

\[
\boxed{140}
\]
