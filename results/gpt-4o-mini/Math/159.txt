In triangle \( ABC \), we know that \( \angle A = 90^\circ \). The cosine of an angle in a right triangle is defined as the ratio of the length of the adjacent side to the hypotenuse. 

In this case, since \( A \) is the right angle, we can analyze the sides:

- \( AB \) is one of the legs of the triangle, with length \( 6 \).
- \( BC \) is the hypotenuse, with length \( 10 \).
- \( AC \) is the other leg, which we can find using the Pythagorean theorem.

The Pythagorean theorem states that:

\[
AB^2 + AC^2 = BC^2
\]

Substituting the known values:

\[
6^2 + AC^2 = 10^2
\]

Calculating the squares:

\[
36 + AC^2 = 100
\]

Now, we isolate \( AC^2 \):

\[
AC^2 = 100 - 36 = 64
\]

Taking the square root gives:

\[
AC = \sqrt{64} = 8
\]

Now, we can find \( \cos A \). Since \( A \) is \( 90^\circ \), we know that:

\[
\cos 90^\circ = 0
\]

Thus, the value of \( \cos A \) is:

\[
\boxed{0}
\]
