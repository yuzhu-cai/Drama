To solve the equation \(\cos 4x = -\frac{1}{2}\), we start by determining the angles for which the cosine function equals \(-\frac{1}{2}\). The cosine function equals \(-\frac{1}{2}\) at the angles:

\[
\theta = \frac{2\pi}{3} + 2k\pi \quad \text{and} \quad \theta = \frac{4\pi}{3} + 2k\pi
\]

for any integer \(k\).

Since we have \(\cos 4x = -\frac{1}{2}\), we set \(4x\) equal to these angles:

1. \(4x = \frac{2\pi}{3} + 2k\pi\)
2. \(4x = \frac{4\pi}{3} + 2k\pi\)

Now, we will solve each equation for \(x\).

### For the first equation:

\[
4x = \frac{2\pi}{3} + 2k\pi
\]
Dividing both sides by 4 gives:

\[
x = \frac{2\pi}{12} + \frac{k\pi}{2} = \frac{\pi}{6} + \frac{k\pi}{2}
\]

### For the second equation:

\[
4x = \frac{4\pi}{3} + 2k\pi
\]
Dividing both sides by 4 gives:

\[
x = \frac{4\pi}{12} + \frac{k\pi}{2} = \frac{\pi}{3} + \frac{k\pi}{2}
\]

### Combining the solutions:

Now we have two sets of solutions:

1. From the first equation: 
   \[
   x = \frac{\pi}{6} + \frac{k\pi}{2}
   \]
2. From the second equation:
   \[
   x = \frac{\pi}{3} + \frac{k\pi}{2}
   \]

To express both solutions in a similar form, we rewrite \(\frac{\pi}{3}\) as \(\frac{2\pi}{6}\):

\[
x = \frac{2\pi}{6} + \frac{k\pi}{2}
\]

Now, we can express both solutions in terms of a common format. The first solution can be rewritten as:

\[
x = \frac{(2k + 1)\pi}{6}
\]

and the second solution can be rewritten as:

\[
x = \frac{(2k + 2)\pi}{6} = \frac{(2(k + 1))\pi}{6}
\]

Thus, the general form of the solutions can be expressed as:

\[
x = \frac{(2m + 1)\pi}{6} \quad \text{for integers } m
\]

where \(m\) can take values \(k\) or \(k + 1\).

### Final Form:

The solutions can be expressed in the form \(\frac{(kn \pm 1)\pi}{6}\). Here, we can identify \(k\) from the coefficients of \(n\). 

In our case, we can see that \(k = 2\) because the coefficients of \(n\) in both forms are \(2\).

Thus, the positive value of \(k\) is:

\[
\boxed{2}
\]
