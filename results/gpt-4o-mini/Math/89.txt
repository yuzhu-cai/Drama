To solve the equation \( |3 - 2i + w| = 0 \), we start by recalling the property of the modulus of a complex number. The modulus \( |z| \) of a complex number \( z \) is equal to zero if and only if \( z = 0 \).

Thus, we can set the expression inside the modulus to zero:

\[
3 - 2i + w = 0
\]

To isolate \( w \), we rearrange the equation:

\[
w = - (3 - 2i)
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
w = -3 + 2i
\]

Therefore, the value of \( w \) is 

\[
\boxed{-3 + 2i}
\]
