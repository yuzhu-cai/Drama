Let \( r \) be the common root of the polynomials \( x^2 - 7x + b = 0 \) and \( x^2 + 2x - 2b = 0 \).

Since \( r \) is a root of the first polynomial, we have:

\[
r^2 - 7r + b = 0
\]

From this, we can express \( b \) in terms of \( r \):

\[
b = 7r - r^2
\]

Now, substituting this expression for \( b \) into the second polynomial, we have:

\[
r^2 + 2r - 2b = 0
\]

Substituting \( b = 7r - r^2 \) into this equation gives:

\[
r^2 + 2r - 2(7r - r^2) = 0
\]

Simplifying this, we get:

\[
r^2 + 2r - 14r + 2r^2 = 0
\]

Combining like terms results in:

\[
3r^2 - 12r = 0
\]

Factoring out \( 3r \):

\[
3r(r - 4) = 0
\]

This gives us two possible solutions:

\[
r = 0 \quad \text{or} \quad r = 4
\]

Now, we will check if both values of \( r \) yield a consistent value for \( b \).

1. **For \( r = 0 \)**:

   \[
   b = 7(0) - (0)^2 = 0
   \]

   The first polynomial becomes:

   \[
   x^2 - 7x = 0 \quad \Rightarrow \quad x(x - 7) = 0
   \]

   The roots are \( 0 \) and \( 7 \).

   The second polynomial becomes:

   \[
   x^2 + 2x = 0 \quad \Rightarrow \quad x(x + 2) = 0
   \]

   The roots are \( 0 \) and \( -2 \).

   Thus, \( r = 0 \) is indeed a common root.

2. **For \( r = 4 \)**:

   \[
   b = 7(4) - (4)^2 = 28 - 16 = 12
   \]

   The first polynomial becomes:

   \[
   x^2 - 7x + 12 = 0
   \]

   Factoring gives:

   \[
   (x - 3)(x - 4) = 0
   \]

   The roots are \( 3 \) and \( 4 \).

   The second polynomial becomes:

   \[
   x^2 + 2x - 24 = 0
   \]

   Factoring gives:

   \[
   (x - 4)(x + 6) = 0
   \]

   The roots are \( 4 \) and \( -6 \).

   Thus, \( r = 4 \) is also a common root.

In conclusion, the possible values of the common root are:

\[
\boxed{0, 4}
\]
