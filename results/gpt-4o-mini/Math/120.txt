Let the four consecutive integers be represented as \( n, n+1, n+2, n+3 \).

The sum of these integers can be expressed as:
\[
n + (n+1) + (n+2) + (n+3) = 4n + 6
\]
We know that this sum equals 22:
\[
4n + 6 = 22
\]
To solve for \( n \), we first subtract 6 from both sides:
\[
4n = 22 - 6
\]
\[
4n = 16
\]
Next, we divide both sides by 4:
\[
n = 4
\]

Thus, the four consecutive integers are:
\[
4, 5, 6, 7
\]

Next, we increase each integer by 2:
\[
4 + 2 = 6, \quad 5 + 2 = 7, \quad 6 + 2 = 8, \quad 7 + 2 = 9
\]
This gives us the new set of integers:
\[
6, 7, 8, 9
\]

Now, we multiply each of these integers by 20:
\[
6 \times 20 = 120, \quad 7 \times 20 = 140, \quad 8 \times 20 = 160, \quad 9 \times 20 = 180
\]

The new set of integers is:
\[
120, 140, 160, 180
\]

Finally, we find the sum of this new set:
\[
120 + 140 + 160 + 180
\]

Calculating this step-by-step:
\[
120 + 140 = 260
\]
\[
260 + 160 = 420
\]
\[
420 + 180 = 600
\]

Thus, the sum of the new set of integers is:
\[
\boxed{600}
\]
