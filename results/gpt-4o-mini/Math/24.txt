To find Tamara's score on the misplaced quiz, we start by using the information given about her quiz scores and the arithmetic mean.

The arithmetic mean of her five quiz scores is given as 95%. This means that the total of all five quiz scores divided by 5 equals 95%. We can express this mathematically as follows:

\[
\frac{s_1 + s_2 + s_3 + s_4 + s_5}{5} = 95
\]

Multiplying both sides by 5 gives us:

\[
s_1 + s_2 + s_3 + s_4 + s_5 = 5 \times 95 = 475
\]

Let \( s_5 \) be the score of the misplaced quiz. The scores Tamara can find are 100%, 100%, 99%, and 98%. We can denote these scores as \( s_1 = 100 \), \( s_2 = 100 \), \( s_3 = 99 \), and \( s_4 = 98 \). Now we can calculate the sum of these known scores:

\[
s_1 + s_2 + s_3 + s_4 = 100 + 100 + 99 + 98
\]

Calculating this step-by-step:

\[
100 + 100 = 200
\]
\[
200 + 99 = 299
\]
\[
299 + 98 = 397
\]

Thus, the sum of the known scores is:

\[
s_1 + s_2 + s_3 + s_4 = 397
\]

Now we can substitute this into the equation for the total score:

\[
397 + s_5 = 475
\]

To find \( s_5 \), we solve for it by subtracting 397 from both sides:

\[
s_5 = 475 - 397
\]
\[
s_5 = 78
\]

Therefore, Tamara's score on the misplaced quiz is 

\[
\boxed{78}
\]
