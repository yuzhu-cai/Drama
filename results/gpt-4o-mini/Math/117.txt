To solve the equation 

\[
\frac{2}{x} - \frac{3}{5} + \frac{1}{x} = \frac{1}{5},
\]

we first combine the terms involving \(x\). The left-hand side can be rewritten as:

\[
\frac{2}{x} + \frac{1}{x} - \frac{3}{5} = \frac{3}{x} - \frac{3}{5}.
\]

Thus, the equation simplifies to:

\[
\frac{3}{x} - \frac{3}{5} = \frac{1}{5}.
\]

Next, we can isolate the term involving \(x\) by adding \(\frac{3}{5}\) to both sides:

\[
\frac{3}{x} = \frac{1}{5} + \frac{3}{5}.
\]

Calculating the right-hand side gives:

\[
\frac{1}{5} + \frac{3}{5} = \frac{4}{5}.
\]

Now we have:

\[
\frac{3}{x} = \frac{4}{5}.
\]

To solve for \(x\), we can cross-multiply:

\[
3 \cdot 5 = 4 \cdot x.
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
15 = 4x.
\]

Now, we divide both sides by 4:

\[
x = \frac{15}{4}.
\]

Thus, the solution is 

\[
\boxed{\frac{15}{4}}.
\]
