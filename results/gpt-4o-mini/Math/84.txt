To find the possible rational roots of the polynomial 

\[
2x^3 + a_2 x^2 + a_1 x - 4 = 0,
\]

we can use the Rational Root Theorem. This theorem states that any rational root, expressed in the form \( \frac{p}{q} \), must have \( p \) as a factor of the constant term and \( q \) as a factor of the leading coefficient.

In our polynomial, the constant term is \(-4\) and the leading coefficient is \(2\).

**Step 1: Identify the factors of the constant term \(-4\)**

The factors of \(-4\) are:
\[
\pm 1, \pm 2, \pm 4.
\]

Thus, the possible values for \( p \) (the numerator) are:
\[
p = \pm 1, \pm 2, \pm 4.
\]

**Step 2: Identify the factors of the leading coefficient \(2\)**

The factors of \(2\) are:
\[
\pm 1, \pm 2.
\]

Thus, the possible values for \( q \) (the denominator) are:
\[
q = \pm 1, \pm 2.
\]

**Step 3: Formulate the possible rational roots**

Using the Rational Root Theorem, the possible rational roots \( \frac{p}{q} \) can be formed by taking each \( p \) and dividing it by each \( q \):

1. For \( p = 1 \):
   - \( \frac{1}{1} = 1 \)
   - \( \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{2} \)

2. For \( p = -1 \):
   - \( \frac{-1}{1} = -1 \)
   - \( \frac{-1}{2} = -\frac{1}{2} \)

3. For \( p = 2 \):
   - \( \frac{2}{1} = 2 \)
   - \( \frac{2}{2} = 1 \) (already counted)

4. For \( p = -2 \):
   - \( \frac{-2}{1} = -2 \)
   - \( \frac{-2}{2} = -1 \) (already counted)

5. For \( p = 4 \):
   - \( \frac{4}{1} = 4 \)
   - \( \frac{4}{2} = 2 \) (already counted)

6. For \( p = -4 \):
   - \( \frac{-4}{1} = -4 \)
   - \( \frac{-4}{2} = -2 \) (already counted)

**Step 4: List the unique possible rational roots**

The unique possible rational roots we have found are:
\[
1, -1, \frac{1}{2}, -\frac{1}{2}, 2, -2, 4, -4.
\]

**Step 5: Count the unique possible rational roots**

Counting these unique values, we have:
- \( 1 \)
- \( -1 \)
- \( \frac{1}{2} \)
- \( -\frac{1}{2} \)
- \( 2 \)
- \( -2 \)
- \( 4 \)
- \( -4 \)

This gives us a total of \( 8 \) possible rational roots.

Thus, the number of possible rational roots of the polynomial is 

\[
\boxed{8}.
