To find the minimum value of the expression 

\[
E = \frac{2}{a} + \frac{1}{b}
\]

given the constraint 

\[
a + 2b = 1,
\]

we can express \( b \) in terms of \( a \):

\[
b = \frac{1 - a}{2}.
\]

Substituting this into the expression for \( E \):

\[
E = \frac{2}{a} + \frac{1}{\frac{1 - a}{2}} = \frac{2}{a} + \frac{2}{1 - a}.
\]

Now, we need to minimize 

\[
E(a) = \frac{2}{a} + \frac{2}{1 - a}.
\]

To find the critical points, we first compute the derivative \( E'(a) \):

\[
E'(a) = -\frac{2}{a^2} + \frac{2}{(1 - a)^2}.
\]

Setting the derivative equal to zero gives:

\[
-\frac{2}{a^2} + \frac{2}{(1 - a)^2} = 0.
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
\frac{2}{(1 - a)^2} = \frac{2}{a^2}.
\]

Cross-multiplying yields:

\[
2a^2 = 2(1 - a)^2.
\]

Dividing both sides by 2:

\[
a^2 = (1 - a)^2.
\]

Expanding the right side:

\[
a^2 = 1 - 2a + a^2.
\]

Subtracting \( a^2 \) from both sides:

\[
0 = 1 - 2a.
\]

Solving for \( a \):

\[
2a = 1 \implies a = \frac{1}{2}.
\]

Substituting \( a = \frac{1}{2} \) back into the constraint to find \( b \):

\[
b = \frac{1 - a}{2} = \frac{1 - \frac{1}{2}}{2} = \frac{\frac{1}{2}}{2} = \frac{1}{4}.
\]

Now we can calculate \( E \) at \( a = \frac{1}{2} \) and \( b = \frac{1}{4} \):

\[
E\left(\frac{1}{2}, \frac{1}{4}\right) = \frac{2}{\frac{1}{2}} + \frac{1}{\frac{1}{4}} = 4 + 4 = 8.
\]

To confirm that this is a minimum, we can check the second derivative:

\[
E''(a) = \frac{4}{a^3} + \frac{4}{(1 - a)^3}.
\]

Since \( a \) and \( b \) are positive, both terms are positive, indicating that \( E''(a) > 0 \) for \( a \in (0, 1) \). Thus, \( E(a) \) is convex, and the critical point we found is indeed a minimum.

Therefore, the minimum value of \( E \) is 

\[
\boxed{8}.
\]
