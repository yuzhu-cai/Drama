To find the sum of the roots \( a + b + c \) of the polynomial \( x^3 + 7x^2 - 11x - 2 = 0 \), we can use Vieta's formulas. According to Vieta's, for a cubic polynomial of the form 

\[
x^3 + px^2 + qx + r = 0,
\]

the sum of the roots \( a + b + c \) is given by 

\[
-(\text{coefficient of } x^2).
\]

In our case, the polynomial is 

\[
x^3 + 7x^2 - 11x - 2.
\]

Here, the coefficient of \( x^2 \) is \( 7 \). Therefore, according to Vieta's formulas, we have:

\[
a + b + c = -7.
\]

Thus, the sum of the roots \( a + b + c \) is 

\[
\boxed{-7}.
\]
