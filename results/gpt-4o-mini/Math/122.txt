To find the meeting points, we first calculate the midpoint based on the locations Annie and Barbara initially believed they were at.

Annie's coordinates are given as \( (3, 5) \) and Barbara's initially believed coordinates are \( (-6, 2) \).

The formula for the midpoint \( M \) between two points \( (x_1, y_1) \) and \( (x_2, y_2) \) is:

\[
M = \left( \frac{x_1 + x_2}{2}, \frac{y_1 + y_2}{2} \right)
\]

Substituting in Annie's and Barbara's coordinates:

\[
M = \left( \frac{3 + (-6)}{2}, \frac{5 + 2}{2} \right)
\]

Calculating the \( x \)-coordinate:

\[
\frac{3 - 6}{2} = \frac{-3}{2} = -1.5
\]

Calculating the \( y \)-coordinate:

\[
\frac{5 + 2}{2} = \frac{7}{2} = 3.5
\]

Thus, the midpoint where they initially agreed to meet is:

\[
(-1.5, 3.5)
\]

Next, we find the actual meeting point based on Barbara's correct location, which is \( (-10, 4) \).

Now we calculate the midpoint using Annie's coordinates \( (3, 5) \) and Barbara's actual coordinates \( (-10, 4) \):

\[
M' = \left( \frac{3 + (-10)}{2}, \frac{5 + 4}{2} \right)
\]

Calculating the \( x \)-coordinate:

\[
\frac{3 - 10}{2} = \frac{-7}{2} = -3.5
\]

Calculating the \( y \)-coordinate:

\[
\frac{5 + 4}{2} = \frac{9}{2} = 4.5
\]

Thus, the actual midpoint where they should meet is:

\[
(-3.5, 4.5)
\]

Now, we need to find the positive difference in the \( x \)-coordinates of the two midpoints:

1. The \( x \)-coordinate of the agreed meeting point is \( -1.5 \).
2. The \( x \)-coordinate of the actual meeting point is \( -3.5 \).

Calculating the positive difference:

\[
|-1.5 - (-3.5)| = |-1.5 + 3.5| = |2| = 2
\]

Thus, the positive difference in the \( x \)-coordinates is:

\[
\boxed{2}
\]
