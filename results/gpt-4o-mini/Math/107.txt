Let the three consecutive terms in the arithmetic sequence be represented as \( a - d \), \( a \), and \( a + d \), where \( a \) is the middle term and \( d \) is the common difference.

1. **Finding the difference between the largest and smallest terms:**
   The largest term is \( a + d \) and the smallest term is \( a - d \). The difference between them is:
   \[
   (a + d) - (a - d) = 2d
   \]
   According to the problem, this difference is equal to 14:
   \[
   2d = 14
   \]
   Dividing both sides by 2 gives:
   \[
   d = 7
   \]

2. **Expressing the terms in terms of \( a \):**
   Now we can express the three terms:
   \[
   a - d = a - 7, \quad a, \quad a + d = a + 7
   \]

3. **Adding half of the smallest term to each term:**
   The smallest term is \( a - 7 \). Half of this term is:
   \[
   \frac{1}{2}(a - 7) = \frac{a - 7}{2}
   \]
   Adding this to each term gives:
   - First term: 
     \[
     (a - 7) + \frac{a - 7}{2} = \frac{2(a - 7) + (a - 7)}{2} = \frac{3a - 21}{2}
     \]
   - Second term:
     \[
     a + \frac{a - 7}{2} = \frac{2a + (a - 7)}{2} = \frac{3a - 7}{2}
     \]
   - Third term:
     \[
     (a + 7) + \frac{a - 7}{2} = \frac{2(a + 7) + (a - 7)}{2} = \frac{3a + 7}{2}
     \]

4. **Calculating the sum of the new terms:**
   The sum of the new terms is:
   \[
   \frac{3a - 21}{2} + \frac{3a - 7}{2} + \frac{3a + 7}{2}
   \]
   Combining these:
   \[
   = \frac{(3a - 21) + (3a - 7) + (3a + 7)}{2} = \frac{3a - 21 + 3a - 7 + 3a + 7}{2} = \frac{9a - 21}{2}
   \]

5. **Setting the sum equal to 120:**
   According to the problem, this sum equals 120:
   \[
   \frac{9a - 21}{2} = 120
   \]
   Multiplying both sides by 2 gives:
   \[
   9a - 21 = 240
   \]
   Adding 21 to both sides:
   \[
   9a = 261
   \]
   Dividing by 9:
   \[
   a = 29
   \]

6. **Finding the smallest term:**
   The smallest term is:
   \[
   a - d = 29 - 7 = 22
   \]

Thus, the value of the original smallest term is:
\[
\boxed{22}
\]
