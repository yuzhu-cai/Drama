To find the probability that exactly two of the six 6-sided dice show a 1 and exactly two show a 2, we can follow these steps:

1. **Determine the total number of outcomes when rolling six dice.**  
   Each die has 6 faces, so the total number of outcomes when rolling six dice is:
   \[
   6^6 = 46656.
   \]

2. **Count the favorable outcomes where exactly two dice show a 1 and exactly two dice show a 2.**  
   We need to choose which two dice will show a 1 and which two will show a 2. The remaining two dice can show any of the numbers 3, 4, 5, or 6.

   - **Choose 2 dice to show 1:**  
     The number of ways to choose 2 dice out of 6 to show a 1 is given by the binomial coefficient:
     \[
     \binom{6}{2} = 15.
     \]

   - **Choose 2 dice to show 2:**  
     After choosing 2 dice to show 1, we have 4 dice left. The number of ways to choose 2 out of these 4 dice to show a 2 is:
     \[
     \binom{4}{2} = 6.
     \]

   - **Assign values to the remaining 2 dice:**  
     The remaining 2 dice can show any of the numbers 3, 4, 5, or 6. Each of these 2 dice has 4 options, so the number of ways to assign values to these 2 dice is:
     \[
     4^2 = 16.
     \]

3. **Calculate the total number of favorable outcomes:**  
   The total number of favorable outcomes is the product of the number of ways to choose the dice showing 1 and 2, and the number of ways to assign values to the remaining dice:
   \[
   \text{Total favorable outcomes} = \binom{6}{2} \cdot \binom{4}{2} \cdot 4^2 = 15 \cdot 6 \cdot 16.
   \]

   Now, we calculate this:
   \[
   15 \cdot 6 = 90,
   \]
   \[
   90 \cdot 16 = 1440.
   \]

4. **Calculate the probability:**  
   The probability of getting exactly two 1's and two 2's is the ratio of the number of favorable outcomes to the total number of outcomes:
   \[
   P = \frac{1440}{46656}.
   \]

5. **Simplify the fraction:**  
   To simplify \( \frac{1440}{46656} \), we can find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 1440 and 46656. 

   - The prime factorization of 1440 is:
     \[
     1440 = 2^5 \cdot 3^2 \cdot 5.
     \]
   - The prime factorization of 46656 is:
     \[
     46656 = 6^6 = (2 \cdot 3)^6 = 2^6 \cdot 3^6.
     \]

   The GCD is:
   \[
   \text{GCD}(1440, 46656) = 2^5 \cdot 3^2 = 144.
   \]

   Now we divide both the numerator and the denominator by 144:
   \[
   \frac{1440 \div 144}{46656 \div 144} = \frac{10}{324}.
   \]

   We can simplify \( \frac{10}{324} \) further:
   \[
   \frac{10 \div 2}{324 \div 2} = \frac{5}{162}.
   \]

Thus, the final probability that exactly two of the dice show a 1 and exactly two show a 2 is:
\[
\boxed{\frac{5}{162}}.
