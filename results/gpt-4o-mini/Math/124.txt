To solve the equation \( x(x-3) = 1 \), we start by rearranging it into standard quadratic form:

\[
x^2 - 3x - 1 = 0
\]

Next, we apply the quadratic formula, which is given by:

\[
x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}
\]

In our equation, \( a = 1 \), \( b = -3 \), and \( c = -1 \). Plugging these values into the quadratic formula, we first calculate the discriminant:

\[
b^2 - 4ac = (-3)^2 - 4 \cdot 1 \cdot (-1) = 9 + 4 = 13
\]

Now substituting back into the quadratic formula:

\[
x = \frac{-(-3) \pm \sqrt{13}}{2 \cdot 1} = \frac{3 \pm \sqrt{13}}{2}
\]

This gives us the two solutions:

\[
x_1 = \frac{3 + \sqrt{13}}{2}, \quad x_2 = \frac{3 - \sqrt{13}}{2}
\]

We can express these solutions in the form \( \frac{a+\sqrt{b}}{c} \) and \( \frac{a-\sqrt{b}}{c} \). Here, we identify:

- \( a = 3 \)
- \( b = 13 \)
- \( c = 2 \)

Next, we need to verify that \( a \), \( b \), and \( c \) are all prime numbers:

- \( 3 \) is prime.
- \( 13 \) is prime.
- \( 2 \) is prime.

Now, we calculate the product \( abc \):

\[
abc = 3 \cdot 13 \cdot 2
\]

Calculating step-by-step:

\[
3 \cdot 13 = 39
\]
\[
39 \cdot 2 = 78
\]

Thus, the final answer is:

\[
\boxed{78}
\]
