To find the radius of the right circular cylinder, we can use the formulas for the lateral surface area and volume of a cylinder.

The lateral surface area \( A \) of a right circular cylinder is given by:

\[
A = 2 \pi r h
\]

where \( r \) is the radius and \( h \) is the height of the cylinder.

The volume \( V \) of a right circular cylinder is given by:

\[
V = \pi r^2 h
\]

We are given that the lateral surface area \( A = 3.5 \) square inches and the volume \( V = 3.5 \) cubic inches. Thus, we have the following equations:

1. \( 2 \pi r h = 3.5 \)
2. \( \pi r^2 h = 3.5 \)

From the first equation, we can express \( h \) in terms of \( r \):

\[
h = \frac{3.5}{2 \pi r}
\]

Next, we substitute this expression for \( h \) into the second equation:

\[
\pi r^2 \left( \frac{3.5}{2 \pi r} \right) = 3.5
\]

Simplifying this, we get:

\[
\frac{3.5 r^2}{2 \pi r} = 3.5
\]

This simplifies further to:

\[
\frac{3.5 r}{2 \pi} = 3.5
\]

To eliminate \( 3.5 \) from both sides, we divide by \( 3.5 \):

\[
\frac{r}{2 \pi} = 1
\]

Multiplying both sides by \( 2 \pi \) gives:

\[
r = 2 \pi
\]

Thus, the radius of the cylinder is:

\[
\boxed{2\pi} \text{ inches}
\]
