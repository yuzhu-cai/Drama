To find the points of intersection of the parabolas defined by the equations \( y = x^2 + 4x + 6 \) and \( y = \frac{1}{2}x^2 + x + 6 \), we set the two equations equal to each other:

\[
x^2 + 4x + 6 = \frac{1}{2}x^2 + x + 6.
\]

Next, we simplify this equation by subtracting \( \frac{1}{2}x^2 + x + 6 \) from both sides:

\[
x^2 + 4x + 6 - \left(\frac{1}{2}x^2 + x + 6\right) = 0.
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
x^2 - \frac{1}{2}x^2 + 4x - x + 6 - 6 = 0,
\]

which further simplifies to:

\[
\frac{1}{2}x^2 + 3x = 0.
\]

Factoring out \( x \) gives:

\[
x\left(\frac{1}{2}x + 3\right) = 0.
\]

Setting each factor to zero, we find:

1. \( x = 0 \)
2. \( \frac{1}{2}x + 3 = 0 \) leads to \( \frac{1}{2}x = -3 \) or \( x = -6 \).

Thus, the \( x \)-coordinates of the points of intersection are \( x = 0 \) and \( x = -6 \). We denote these points as \( (a, b) \) and \( (c, d) \) where \( a = -6 \) and \( c = 0 \).

Next, we calculate \( c - a \):

\[
c - a = 0 - (-6) = 0 + 6 = 6.
\]

Finally, we conclude that the value of \( c - a \) is:

\[
\boxed{6}.
