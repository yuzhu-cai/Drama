To solve for \( x \), we start by determining the distance to the park based on the speed and time for the outbound and return trips.

1. **Distance to the park**:
   The speed while going to the park is \( x^2 \) miles per hour, and the time taken is \( 3 \) hours. Thus, the distance \( d \) to the park can be calculated as:
   \[
   d = \text{speed} \times \text{time} = x^2 \times 3 = 3x^2 \text{ miles}
   \]

2. **Distance back home**:
   On the return trip, the speed is \( 16 - 4x \) miles per hour, and the time taken is \( 4 \) hours. Therefore, the distance back home is:
   \[
   d = \text{speed} \times \text{time} = (16 - 4x) \times 4 = 64 - 16x \text{ miles}
   \]

3. **Setting the distances equal**:
   Since the distance to the park and the distance back home are the same, we can set the two expressions for distance equal to each other:
   \[
   3x^2 = 64 - 16x
   \]

4. **Rearranging the equation**:
   Rearranging gives us:
   \[
   3x^2 + 16x - 64 = 0
   \]

5. **Using the quadratic formula**:
   We can solve this quadratic equation using the quadratic formula \( x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \), where \( a = 3 \), \( b = 16 \), and \( c = -64 \).
   First, we calculate the discriminant:
   \[
   b^2 - 4ac = 16^2 - 4 \cdot 3 \cdot (-64) = 256 + 768 = 1024
   \]
   Now, we take the square root of the discriminant:
   \[
   \sqrt{1024} = 32
   \]
   Now we can substitute back into the quadratic formula:
   \[
   x = \frac{-16 \pm 32}{2 \cdot 3} = \frac{-16 \pm 32}{6}
   \]
   This gives us two potential solutions:
   \[
   x = \frac{16}{6} = \frac{8}{3} \quad \text{and} \quad x = \frac{-48}{6} = -8
   \]

6. **Selecting the valid solution**:
   Since \( x > 0 \), we discard \( x = -8 \) and keep:
   \[
   x = \frac{8}{3}
   \]

Thus, the value of \( x \) is:
\[
\boxed{\frac{8}{3}}
\]
