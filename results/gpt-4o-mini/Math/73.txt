To solve the equation 

\[
\frac{1}{a} + \frac{1}{b} = \frac{2}{17},
\]

we start by finding a common denominator for the left-hand side:

\[
\frac{b + a}{ab} = \frac{2}{17}.
\]

Cross-multiplying gives:

\[
17(a + b) = 2ab.
\]

Rearranging this equation, we have:

\[
2ab - 17a - 17b = 0.
\]

Next, we can rearrange it into a standard quadratic form:

\[
2ab - 17a - 17b + 289 = 289.
\]

This can be factored as:

\[
(2a - 17)(2b - 17) = 289.
\]

Now, we need to find the pairs of integers \((x, y)\) such that:

\[
xy = 289,
\]

where \(x = 2a - 17\) and \(y = 2b - 17\). The integer 289 can be factored as follows:

\[
289 = 17^2.
\]

The positive divisors of 289 are \(1, 17, 289\). Thus, the pairs \((x, y)\) that satisfy \(xy = 289\) are:

1. \((1, 289)\)
2. \((17, 17)\)
3. \((289, 1)\)

Now we will convert these pairs back to \((a, b)\):

1. For the pair \((1, 289)\):
   \[
   2a - 17 = 1 \implies 2a = 18 \implies a = 9,
   \]
   \[
   2b - 17 = 289 \implies 2b = 306 \implies b = 153.
   \]
   Thus, one solution is \((9, 153)\).

2. For the pair \((17, 17)\):
   \[
   2a - 17 = 17 \implies 2a = 34 \implies a = 17,
   \]
   \[
   2b - 17 = 17 \implies 2b = 34 \implies b = 17.
   \]
   Thus, another solution is \((17, 17)\).

3. For the pair \((289, 1)\):
   \[
   2a - 17 = 289 \implies 2a = 306 \implies a = 153,
   \]
   \[
   2b - 17 = 1 \implies 2b = 18 \implies b = 9.
   \]
   Thus, the final solution is \((153, 9)\).

Now we summarize the pairs of positive integers \((a, b)\):

- \((9, 153)\)
- \((17, 17)\)
- \((153, 9)\)

Since \((9, 153)\) and \((153, 9)\) are distinct pairs, we count them as separate solutions.

Thus, the total number of pairs of positive integers \((a, b)\) that satisfy the equation is 

\[
\boxed{3}.
\]
