To find the number of students who take neither French nor Spanish, we can use the principle of inclusion-exclusion.

Let:
- \( F \) be the number of students taking French.
- \( S \) be the number of students taking Spanish.
- \( B \) be the number of students taking both languages.

From the problem, we have:
- \( F = 8 \)
- \( S = 12 \)
- \( B = 3 \)

First, we calculate the number of students taking at least one language (either French or Spanish) using the formula:

\[
\text{Number of students taking at least one language} = F + S - B
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
\text{Number of students taking at least one language} = 8 + 12 - 3 = 17
\]

Now, to find the number of students who take neither language, we subtract the number of students taking at least one language from the total number of students:

\[
\text{Number of students taking neither language} = \text{Total students} - \text{Number of students taking at least one language}
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
\text{Number of students taking neither language} = 30 - 17 = 13
\]

Thus, the number of students who take neither French nor Spanish is \( \boxed{13} \).
