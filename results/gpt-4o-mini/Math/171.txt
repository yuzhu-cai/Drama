To find the minimum height of the cylindrical container that can hold all the milk from the hemispherical cup, we first need to calculate the volume of the hemispherical cup.

The formula for the volume \( V \) of a hemisphere with radius \( r \) is given by:

\[
V = \frac{2}{3} \pi r^3
\]

In this case, the radius \( r \) of the hemispherical cup is 3 inches. Plugging this value into the formula, we have:

\[
V = \frac{2}{3} \pi (3)^3
\]

Calculating \( (3)^3 \):

\[
(3)^3 = 27
\]

Now substituting this back into the volume formula:

\[
V = \frac{2}{3} \pi \cdot 27 = \frac{54}{3} \pi = 18 \pi
\]

Thus, the volume of the milk in the hemispherical cup is \( 18 \pi \) cubic inches.

Next, we need to determine the height of the cylindrical container that has a radius of 2 inches and can hold this volume of milk. The formula for the volume \( V \) of a cylinder with radius \( r \) and height \( h \) is:

\[
V = \pi r^2 h
\]

Here, the radius \( r \) of the cylindrical container is 2 inches. We can set up the equation for the volume of the cylinder:

\[
V = \pi (2)^2 h = \pi \cdot 4 h = 4 \pi h
\]

We want this volume to be at least equal to the volume of the milk, which is \( 18 \pi \):

\[
4 \pi h \geq 18 \pi
\]

Dividing both sides by \( \pi \) (since \( \pi \) is positive, we can do this without changing the inequality):

\[
4h \geq 18
\]

Now, dividing both sides by 4:

\[
h \geq \frac{18}{4} = 4.5
\]

Thus, the minimum height \( h \) of the cylindrical container must be at least 4.5 inches. 

Expressing this as a decimal to the nearest tenth, we find:

\[
\boxed{4.5}
\]
