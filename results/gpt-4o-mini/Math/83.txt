Let \( a, b, c \) be the roots of the polynomial 

\[
x^3 - 6x^2 + 3x + 1 = 0.
\]

Using Vieta's formulas, we know:

- \( a + b + c = 6 \)
- \( ab + bc + ca = 3 \)
- \( abc = -1 \)

We need to find the value of \( a^2b + b^2c + c^2a \). We can express this in terms of symmetric sums. Notice that:

\[
a^2b + b^2c + c^2a = ab(a + b + c) - abc.
\]

Substituting the values from Vieta's formulas:

1. \( a + b + c = 6 \)
2. \( abc = -1 \)

Thus, we have:

\[
a^2b + b^2c + c^2a = ab(6) - (-1) = 6ab + 1.
\]

Next, we need to find \( ab \). We can find \( ab \) using the identity:

\[
(ab + ac + bc)^2 = (ab)^2 + (ac)^2 + (bc)^2 + 2(ab \cdot ac + ac \cdot bc + bc \cdot ab).
\]

Let \( p = ab \), \( q = ac \), \( r = bc \). From Vieta's, we have:

\[
p + q + r = 3,
\]

and 

\[
pqr = abc \cdot (a + b + c) = -1 \cdot 6 = -6.
\]

We can express \( q \) and \( r \) in terms of \( p \):

\[
q + r = 3 - p.
\]

The product \( q \cdot r \) can be expressed as:

\[
qr = \frac{pqr}{p} = \frac{-6}{p}.
\]

Now, we can substitute \( q + r \) and \( qr \) into the quadratic equation formed by \( x^2 - (q + r)x + qr = 0 \):

\[
x^2 - (3 - p)x + \frac{-6}{p} = 0.
\]

The discriminant of this quadratic must be non-negative for \( q \) and \( r \) to be real:

\[
(3 - p)^2 - 4 \cdot \frac{-6}{p} \geq 0.
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
(3 - p)^2 + \frac{24}{p} \geq 0.
\]

This inequality is always satisfied since both terms are non-negative. We can find the values of \( ab \) by solving the cubic equation for \( ab \):

Let \( ab = p \). Then we have:

\[
p + (3 - p) + \frac{-6}{p} = 0 \implies 3 - \frac{6}{p} = 0 \implies p = 2.
\]

Now substituting \( p = 2 \) back into our expression for \( a^2b + b^2c + c^2a \):

\[
a^2b + b^2c + c^2a = 6(2) + 1 = 12 + 1 = 13.
\]

Thus, the only possible value of \( a^2b + b^2c + c^2a \) is:

\[
\boxed{13}.
\]
