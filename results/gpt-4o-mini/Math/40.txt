To find the area of the rectangle, we first need to determine the values of \( x \) based on the given perimeter.

The formula for the perimeter \( P \) of a rectangle is given by:

\[
P = 2 \times (\text{length} + \text{width})
\]

In this case, the length \( L \) is \( 3x + 10 \) feet and the width \( W \) is \( x + 12 \) feet. Therefore, we can express the perimeter as:

\[
P = 2 \times ((3x + 10) + (x + 12))
\]

Simplifying the expression inside the parentheses:

\[
3x + 10 + x + 12 = 4x + 22
\]

Now substituting back into the perimeter formula:

\[
P = 2 \times (4x + 22) = 8x + 44
\]

We know that the perimeter is 76 feet, so we set up the equation:

\[
8x + 44 = 76
\]

To solve for \( x \), we first subtract 44 from both sides:

\[
8x = 76 - 44
\]
\[
8x = 32
\]

Next, we divide both sides by 8:

\[
x = 4
\]

Now that we have \( x \), we can find the dimensions of the rectangle. First, we calculate the length:

\[
L = 3x + 10 = 3(4) + 10 = 12 + 10 = 22 \text{ feet}
\]

Next, we calculate the width:

\[
W = x + 12 = 4 + 12 = 16 \text{ feet}
\]

Now we can find the area \( A \) of the rectangle using the formula:

\[
A = \text{length} \times \text{width} = L \times W
\]

Substituting the values we found:

\[
A = 22 \times 16
\]

Calculating the area:

\[
A = 352 \text{ square feet}
\]

Thus, the area of the rectangle is 

\[
\boxed{352} \text{ square feet}.
\]
