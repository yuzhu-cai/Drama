Let \( n \) be the number of quarters Wendy has. We know from the problem that:

1. When stacked in piles of 5, there are 3 quarters left over:
   \[
   n \equiv 3 \pmod{5}
   \]

2. When stacked in piles of 7, there are 5 quarters left over:
   \[
   n \equiv 5 \pmod{7}
   \]

Additionally, since Wendy has less than ten dollars worth of quarters, we have:
\[
n < 40 \quad \text{(since each quarter is worth $0.25)}
\]

Now, we will solve the system of congruences. Starting with the first congruence:
\[
n = 5k + 3 \quad \text{for some integer } k
\]

Substituting this expression for \( n \) into the second congruence:
\[
5k + 3 \equiv 5 \pmod{7}
\]
Subtracting 3 from both sides gives:
\[
5k \equiv 2 \pmod{7}
\]

To solve for \( k \), we need to find the multiplicative inverse of 5 modulo 7. We can test values:
- \( 5 \times 1 = 5 \equiv 5 \)
- \( 5 \times 2 = 10 \equiv 3 \)
- \( 5 \times 3 = 15 \equiv 1 \)

Thus, the multiplicative inverse of 5 modulo 7 is 3. We multiply both sides of the equation \( 5k \equiv 2 \) by 3:
\[
k \equiv 6 \pmod{7}
\]
This means:
\[
k = 7m + 6 \quad \text{for some integer } m
\]

Substituting back into the expression for \( n \):
\[
n = 5(7m + 6) + 3 = 35m + 30 + 3 = 35m + 33
\]

Now we need to find \( n < 40 \):
\[
35m + 33 < 40
\]
Subtracting 33 from both sides:
\[
35m < 7
\]
Dividing by 35 gives:
\[
m < \frac{7}{35} = \frac{1}{5}
\]

Since \( m \) must be a non-negative integer, the only possible value for \( m \) is 0. Thus:
\[
m = 0 \implies n = 35(0) + 33 = 33
\]

Finally, we check if \( n = 33 \) satisfies both original conditions:
1. \( 33 \div 5 = 6 \) remainder \( 3 \) (satisfies \( n \equiv 3 \pmod{5} \))
2. \( 33 \div 7 = 4 \) remainder \( 5 \) (satisfies \( n \equiv 5 \pmod{7} \))

Since both conditions are satisfied, the number of quarters Wendy has is:
\[
\boxed{33}
\]
