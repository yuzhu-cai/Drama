Let \( y = \sqrt{x + \sqrt{x + \sqrt{x + \ldots}}} \). According to the problem, we have:

\[
y = 5
\]

This implies:

\[
5 = \sqrt{x + \sqrt{x + \sqrt{x + \ldots}}}
\]

Since \( y \) represents the entire nested radical, we can substitute \( y \) back into the equation:

\[
5 = \sqrt{x + y}
\]

Substituting \( y = 5 \) into the equation gives:

\[
5 = \sqrt{x + 5}
\]

Next, we square both sides to eliminate the square root:

\[
5^2 = x + 5
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
25 = x + 5
\]

Now, we solve for \( x \) by subtracting 5 from both sides:

\[
x = 25 - 5 = 20
\]

Thus, the value of \( x \) is:

\[
\boxed{20}
\]

To verify, we substitute \( x = 20 \) back into the original equation:

\[
\sqrt{20 + \sqrt{20 + \sqrt{20 + \ldots}}}
\]

Let \( z = \sqrt{20 + \sqrt{20 + \sqrt{20 + \ldots}}} \). Then we have:

\[
z = \sqrt{20 + z}
\]

Squaring both sides gives:

\[
z^2 = 20 + z
\]

Rearranging this results in:

\[
z^2 - z - 20 = 0
\]

We can solve this quadratic equation using the quadratic formula:

\[
z = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} = \frac{1 \pm \sqrt{1 + 80}}{2} = \frac{1 \pm \sqrt{81}}{2} = \frac{1 \pm 9}{2}
\]

Calculating the two possible values:

\[
z = \frac{10}{2} = 5 \quad \text{and} \quad z = \frac{-8}{2} = -4
\]

Since \( z \) represents a square root, we discard the negative solution. Thus, \( z = 5 \), confirming that:

\[
\sqrt{20 + \sqrt{20 + \sqrt{20 + \ldots}}} = 5
\]

This verifies our solution, and the value of \( x \) is indeed:

\[
\boxed{20}
\]
