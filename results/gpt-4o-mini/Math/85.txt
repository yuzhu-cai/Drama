To solve the problem, we first need to understand the behavior of the sequence \( \tau^n \) where \( \tau = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} \) (the golden ratio). The value of \( \tau \) is approximately 1.618, and it satisfies the equation \( \tau^2 = \tau + 1 \).

The sequence \( \tau^n \) grows exponentially as \( n \) increases. We are interested in the sum:

\[
S = \sum_{n = 0}^\infty \frac{\lfloor \tau^n \rceil}{2^n}.
\]

To compute \( S \), we need to analyze \( \lfloor \tau^n \rceil \). The value \( \tau^n \) can be expressed in terms of Fibonacci numbers. Specifically, we have:

\[
\tau^n = \frac{F_{n+1}}{\sqrt{5}} + \frac{F_n}{\sqrt{5}} \quad \text{(where \( F_n \) is the \( n \)-th Fibonacci number)},
\]

where \( F_0 = 0, F_1 = 1, F_2 = 1, F_3 = 2, F_4 = 3, \ldots \).

The closest integer to \( \tau^n \) can be approximated as follows:

\[
\lfloor \tau^n \rceil = \lfloor \tau^n + 0.5 \rfloor.
\]

Now, we can express \( S \) in terms of the Fibonacci numbers:

\[
S = \sum_{n=0}^\infty \frac{\lfloor \tau^n \rceil}{2^n} = \sum_{n=0}^\infty \frac{F_n}{2^n} + \sum_{n=0}^\infty \frac{F_{n-1}}{2^n}.
\]

The first sum can be computed using the generating function for Fibonacci numbers:

\[
\sum_{n=0}^\infty F_n x^n = \frac{x}{1 - x - x^2}.
\]

Setting \( x = \frac{1}{2} \):

\[
\sum_{n=0}^\infty F_n \left( \frac{1}{2} \right)^n = \frac{\frac{1}{2}}{1 - \frac{1}{2} - \left( \frac{1}{2} \right)^2} = \frac{\frac{1}{2}}{\frac{1}{2} - \frac{1}{4}} = \frac{\frac{1}{2}}{\frac{1}{4}} = 2.
\]

The second sum can be computed similarly:

\[
\sum_{n=0}^\infty F_{n-1} \left( \frac{1}{2} \right)^n = \frac{1}{2} \sum_{n=0}^\infty F_n \left( \frac{1}{2} \right)^n = \frac{1}{2} \cdot 2 = 1.
\]

Thus, we have:

\[
S = 2 + 1 = 3.
\]

Therefore, the final result is:

\[
\boxed{3}.
