To solve the quadratic equation \( x^2 - 8x - 49 = 0 \) by completing the square, we first isolate the quadratic and linear terms on one side of the equation:

\[
x^2 - 8x = 49
\]

Next, we complete the square for the left-hand side. To do this, we take the coefficient of \( x \), which is \(-8\), divide it by 2, and then square it:

\[
\left(-\frac{8}{2}\right)^2 = (-4)^2 = 16
\]

We add and subtract this square (16) on the left-hand side:

\[
x^2 - 8x + 16 - 16 = 49
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
(x - 4)^2 - 16 = 49
\]

Next, we move \(-16\) to the right side:

\[
(x - 4)^2 = 49 + 16
\]

Calculating the right side gives:

\[
(x - 4)^2 = 65
\]

Now, we have rewritten the equation in the form of \((ax + b)^2 + c\). Here, we can identify:

- \(a = 1\) (since the coefficient of \(x\) in \((x - 4)\) is 1),
- \(b = -4\),
- \(c = -65\) (since we can rewrite \(65\) as \(-(-65)\)).

Now we need to find \(ab\):

\[
ab = 1 \cdot (-4) = -4
\]

Thus, the final answer is:

\[
\boxed{-4}
\]
