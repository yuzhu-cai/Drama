To find the number of numbers in the list \( 6, 7, 10, 11, 14, 15, \ldots, 94, 95, 98 \), we first need to identify the pattern in the sequence.

The numbers can be grouped based on their properties:
- The first group consists of numbers that are congruent to \( 6 \mod 4 \): \( 6, 10, 14, \ldots, 94 \).
- The second group consists of numbers that are congruent to \( 7 \mod 4 \): \( 7, 11, 15, \ldots, 95 \).
- The last number \( 98 \) is included separately.

### Step 1: Count the numbers in the first group

The first group is \( 6, 10, 14, \ldots, 94 \). This is an arithmetic sequence where:
- The first term \( a = 6 \)
- The common difference \( d = 4 \)

To find the number of terms \( n \) in this sequence, we use the formula for the \( n \)-th term of an arithmetic sequence:
\[
a_n = a + (n-1)d
\]
Setting \( a_n = 94 \):
\[
94 = 6 + (n-1) \cdot 4
\]
Subtracting \( 6 \) from both sides:
\[
88 = (n-1) \cdot 4
\]
Dividing by \( 4 \):
\[
22 = n - 1
\]
Thus,
\[
n = 23
\]

### Step 2: Count the numbers in the second group

The second group is \( 7, 11, 15, \ldots, 95 \). This is also an arithmetic sequence where:
- The first term \( a = 7 \)
- The common difference \( d = 4 \)

Again, we find the number of terms \( n \):
Setting \( a_n = 95 \):
\[
95 = 7 + (n-1) \cdot 4
\]
Subtracting \( 7 \) from both sides:
\[
88 = (n-1) \cdot 4
\]
Dividing by \( 4 \):
\[
22 = n - 1
\]
Thus,
\[
n = 23
\]

### Step 3: Count the last number

The last number \( 98 \) is not part of the two groups above, so we add \( 1 \) to our total count.

### Step 4: Calculate the total count

Adding the counts from both groups and the last number:
\[
23 + 23 + 1 = 47
\]

Thus, the total number of numbers in the list is \( \boxed{47} \).
