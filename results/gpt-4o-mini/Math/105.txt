To solve the equation \((3^k)^6 = 3^6\), we can start by simplifying the left side using the property of exponents that states \((a^m)^n = a^{m \cdot n}\). Applying this property, we have:

\[
(3^k)^6 = 3^{k \cdot 6} = 3^{6k}
\]

Now, we can rewrite the equation as:

\[
3^{6k} = 3^6
\]

Since the bases are the same, we can set the exponents equal to each other:

\[
6k = 6
\]

To isolate \(k\), we divide both sides by 6:

\[
k = 1
\]

Thus, the value of \(k\) is 

\[
\boxed{1}
\]
