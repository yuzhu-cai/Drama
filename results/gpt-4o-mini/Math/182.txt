To determine the probability \( p \) that two random numbers \( x \) and \( y \) (where \( x, y \) are uniformly distributed in the interval \( [0, 1] \)) and the number \( 1 \) can form the sides of an obtuse triangle, we start by recalling the triangle inequality and the condition for an obtuse triangle.

### Step 1: Triangle Inequality Conditions
For \( x, y, 1 \) to form a triangle, the following inequalities must hold:
1. \( x + y > 1 \)
2. \( x + 1 > y \) (which simplifies to \( x > y - 1 \), always true since \( y \leq 1 \))
3. \( y + 1 > x \) (which simplifies to \( y > x - 1 \), always true since \( x \leq 1 \))

Thus, the only relevant triangle inequality is \( x + y > 1 \).

### Step 2: Condition for Obtuse Triangle
For the triangle to be obtuse, one of the following conditions must hold:
1. \( x^2 + y^2 < 1^2 \) (i.e., \( x^2 + y^2 < 1 \))
2. \( x^2 + 1^2 < y^2 \) (i.e., \( x^2 + 1 < y^2 \), which is impossible since \( x^2 \geq 0 \))
3. \( y^2 + 1^2 < x^2 \) (i.e., \( y^2 + 1 < x^2 \), which is also impossible)

Thus, the only condition we need to check is \( x^2 + y^2 < 1 \).

### Step 3: Region of Interest
We need to find the area of the region defined by:
1. \( x + y > 1 \)
2. \( x^2 + y^2 < 1 \)

### Step 4: Graphical Representation
The line \( x + y = 1 \) intersects the axes at \( (1, 0) \) and \( (0, 1) \). The circle \( x^2 + y^2 = 1 \) is centered at the origin with radius \( 1 \).

### Step 5: Finding the Area
We will find the area of the region where both conditions hold. The area of interest is the part of the unit circle that lies above the line \( x + y = 1 \).

#### Step 5.1: Intersection Points
To find the intersection points of the line and the circle, we solve:
\[
x + y = 1 \quad \text{and} \quad x^2 + y^2 = 1.
\]
Substituting \( y = 1 - x \) into the circle's equation:
\[
x^2 + (1 - x)^2 = 1,
\]
\[
x^2 + (1 - 2x + x^2) = 1,
\]
\[
2x^2 - 2x + 1 - 1 = 0,
\]
\[
2x^2 - 2x = 0,
\]
\[
2x(x - 1) = 0.
\]
Thus, \( x = 0 \) or \( x = 1 \). The corresponding \( y \) values are \( y = 1 \) and \( y = 0 \) respectively. The intersection points are \( (0, 1) \) and \( (1, 0) \).

#### Step 5.2: Area Calculation
The area of the sector of the circle above the line \( x + y = 1 \) can be calculated by integrating or using geometric properties.

The area of the triangle formed by the points \( (0, 0) \), \( (1, 0) \), and \( (0, 1) \) is:
\[
\text{Area of triangle} = \frac{1}{2} \times 1 \times 1 = \frac{1}{2}.
\]

The area of the quarter circle (in the first quadrant) is:
\[
\text{Area of quarter circle} = \frac{1}{4} \pi.
\]

The area of the region where \( x + y > 1 \) and \( x^2 + y^2 < 1 \) is:
\[
\text{Area of sector} = \text{Area of quarter circle} - \text{Area of triangle} = \frac{1}{4} \pi - \frac{1}{2}.
\]

### Step 6: Total Area of the Triangle
The total area of the triangle formed by \( x, y \) in the unit square is \( \frac{1}{2} \).

### Step 7: Probability Calculation
Thus, the probability \( p \) that \( x, y, 1 \) form an obtuse triangle is:
\[
p = \frac{\frac{1}{4} \pi - \frac{1}{2}}{\frac{1}{2}} = \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{1}{4} \pi - \frac{1}{2} \right) = \frac{\pi}{8} - \frac{1}{4}.
\]

### Step 8: Final Calculation
We need to find \( 4p \):
\[
4p = 4 \left( \frac{\pi}{8} - \frac{1}{4} \right) = \frac{\pi}{2} - 1.
\]

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{\frac{\pi}{2} - 1}.
