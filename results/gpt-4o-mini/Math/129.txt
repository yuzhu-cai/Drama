To find the value of \( 2 * 6 \) using the operation defined by \( a * b = a^b + b^a \), we will substitute \( a = 2 \) and \( b = 6 \) into the expression.

First, we calculate \( 2^6 \):

\[
2^6 = 64
\]

Next, we calculate \( 6^2 \):

\[
6^2 = 36
\]

Now, we can substitute these values back into the operation:

\[
2 * 6 = 2^6 + 6^2 = 64 + 36
\]

Now, we perform the addition:

\[
64 + 36 = 100
\]

Thus, the value of \( 2 * 6 \) is 

\[
\boxed{100}
\]
