To find the sum of all the digits used to write the whole numbers from 1 to 110, we can break the problem down into manageable parts by considering the contributions from different ranges of numbers.

### Step 1: Count the digits from 1 to 9
The numbers from 1 to 9 are single-digit numbers. The sum of these digits is:

\[
1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8 + 9 = \frac{9 \times (9 + 1)}{2} = 45
\]

### Step 2: Count the digits from 10 to 99
Next, we consider the two-digit numbers from 10 to 99. Each two-digit number can be represented as \(ab\), where \(a\) is the tens digit and \(b\) is the units digit.

#### Tens digits (from 10 to 99):
- The tens digits can be 1 through 9.
- Each tens digit appears 10 times (for example, the digit 1 appears in 10, 11, ..., 19).
- The contribution from the tens digits is:

\[
10 \times (1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8 + 9) = 10 \times 45 = 450
\]

#### Units digits (from 10 to 99):
- The units digits can be 0 through 9.
- Each units digit appears in each complete set of ten numbers (10-19, 20-29, ..., 90-99).
- There are 9 complete sets of ten numbers (10-19, ..., 90-99), so each units digit appears 9 times.
- The contribution from the units digits is:

\[
9 \times (0 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8 + 9) = 9 \times 45 = 405
\]

### Step 3: Count the digits from 100 to 110
Now, we consider the numbers from 100 to 110. Each number can be represented as \(1bc\), where \(b\) and \(c\) are the digits of the numbers from 0 to 10.

- The hundreds digit contributes \(1\) for each of the 11 numbers (100 to 110):

\[
1 \times 11 = 11
\]

- The tens digit \(b\) is \(0\) for 100 to 109 and \(1\) for 110. Thus, the contribution from the tens digits is:

\[
0 \times 10 + 1 \times 1 = 0 + 1 = 1
\]

- The units digits \(c\) range from \(0\) to \(9\) for 100 to 109 and \(0\) for 110. Thus, the contribution from the units digits is:

\[
0 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8 + 9 + 0 = 45 + 0 = 45
\]

### Step 4: Combine all contributions
Now, we can sum all the contributions:

- From 1 to 9: \(45\)
- From 10 to 99: \(450 + 405 = 855\)
- From 100 to 110: \(11 + 1 + 45 = 57\)

Adding these together gives:

\[
45 + 855 + 57 = 957
\]

Thus, the sum of all the digits used to write the whole numbers from 1 to 110 is:

\[
\boxed{957}
\]
