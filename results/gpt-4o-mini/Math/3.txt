To analyze the curve defined by the equation 

\[
r^2 \cos 2\theta = 4,
\]

we can start by using the double angle identity for cosine, which states that 

\[
\cos 2\theta = \cos^2 \theta - \sin^2 \theta.
\]

In polar coordinates, we have \(r^2 = x^2 + y^2\), where \(x = r \cos \theta\) and \(y = r \sin \theta\). We can express \(\cos 2\theta\) in terms of \(x\) and \(y\):

\[
\cos 2\theta = \frac{x^2 - y^2}{r^2}.
\]

Substituting this into the original equation gives:

\[
r^2 \left(\frac{x^2 - y^2}{r^2}\right) = 4.
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
x^2 - y^2 = 4.
\]

The equation \(x^2 - y^2 = 4\) is the standard form of a hyperbola. 

Thus, the curve defined by the equation \(r^2 \cos 2\theta = 4\) is a hyperbola.

The correct option is 

\[
\boxed{E}.
