To find the height \( h \) of triangle \( PQR \), we can use the formula for the area of a triangle:

\[
\text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{base} \times \text{height}
\]

In this case, we know the area of triangle \( PQR \) is \( 27 \, \text{cm}^2 \) and the base measures \( 6 \, \text{cm} \). We can substitute these values into the formula:

\[
27 = \frac{1}{2} \times 6 \times h
\]

Now, we simplify the equation. First, calculate \( \frac{1}{2} \times 6 \):

\[
\frac{1}{2} \times 6 = 3
\]

So the equation becomes:

\[
27 = 3h
\]

Next, we solve for \( h \) by dividing both sides by \( 3 \):

\[
h = \frac{27}{3} = 9
\]

Thus, the height \( h \) of triangle \( PQR \) is 

\[
\boxed{9} \, \text{cm}
\]
