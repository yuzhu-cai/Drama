Let \( x \) be defined as follows:

\[
x = \frac{1}{2 - \frac{1}{2 - \frac{1}{2 - \ldots}}}
\]

Notice that the expression inside the denominator is also \( x \). Therefore, we can rewrite the equation as:

\[
x = \frac{1}{2 - x}
\]

To eliminate the fraction, we can multiply both sides by \( 2 - x \):

\[
x(2 - x) = 1
\]

Expanding the left side gives:

\[
2x - x^2 = 1
\]

Rearranging this equation leads to:

\[
x^2 - 2x + 1 = 0
\]

This can be factored as:

\[
(x - 1)^2 = 0
\]

Thus, we find:

\[
x - 1 = 0 \quad \Rightarrow \quad x = 1
\]

To verify, we substitute \( x = 1 \) back into the original equation:

\[
1 = \frac{1}{2 - 1} = \frac{1}{1} = 1
\]

This confirms our solution is correct. Therefore, the numerical value of \( x \) is:

\[
\boxed{1}
\]
