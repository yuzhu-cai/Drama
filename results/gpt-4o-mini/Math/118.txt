Let the number be \( x \). According to the problem, we can set up the equation:

\[
3 + \frac{1}{x} = \frac{7}{x}
\]

To eliminate the fractions, we can multiply both sides of the equation by \( x \) (assuming \( x \neq 0 \)):

\[
3x + 1 = 7
\]

Next, we can isolate \( x \) by subtracting 1 from both sides:

\[
3x = 6
\]

Now, divide both sides by 3:

\[
x = 2
\]

To verify our solution, we can substitute \( x = 2 \) back into the original equation:

The left side:

\[
3 + \frac{1}{2} = 3 + 0.5 = 3.5
\]

The right side:

\[
\frac{7}{2} = 3.5
\]

Since both sides are equal, our solution is confirmed. Therefore, the number is 

\[
\boxed{2}
\]
