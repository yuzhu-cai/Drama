To find the value of \( f(g(2)) \), we first need to calculate \( g(2) \).

Given the function \( g(x) = x^2 + 3 \), we substitute \( x = 2 \):

\[
g(2) = 2^2 + 3
\]
Calculating \( 2^2 \):

\[
2^2 = 4
\]

Now, adding 3:

\[
g(2) = 4 + 3 = 7
\]

Next, we need to evaluate \( f(g(2)) \), which is \( f(7) \).

The function \( f(x) = x + 1 \) allows us to substitute \( x = 7 \):

\[
f(7) = 7 + 1
\]

Calculating this gives:

\[
f(7) = 8
\]

Thus, the value of \( f(g(2)) \) is 

\[
\boxed{8}
\]
