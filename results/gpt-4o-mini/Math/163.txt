To find the volume of the new cube after doubling the edges of the original cube, we first need to determine the side length of the original cube.

The surface area \( S \) of a cube is given by the formula:

\[
S = 6s^2
\]

where \( s \) is the length of one edge of the cube. Given that the surface area is 600 square inches, we can set up the equation:

\[
6s^2 = 600
\]

To solve for \( s^2 \), we divide both sides by 6:

\[
s^2 = \frac{600}{6} = 100
\]

Next, we take the square root of both sides to find \( s \):

\[
s = \sqrt{100} = 10 \text{ inches}
\]

Now that we have the side length of the original cube, we can find the volume \( V \) of the original cube using the formula:

\[
V = s^3
\]

Substituting \( s = 10 \):

\[
V = 10^3 = 1000 \text{ cubic inches}
\]

Next, we double the edge length of the cube. The new edge length \( s' \) is:

\[
s' = 2s = 2 \times 10 = 20 \text{ inches}
\]

Now we can find the volume of the new cube using the same volume formula:

\[
V' = (s')^3 = (20)^3
\]

Calculating \( (20)^3 \):

\[
(20)^3 = 20 \times 20 \times 20 = 400 \times 20 = 8000 \text{ cubic inches}
\]

Thus, the volume of the new cube is:

\[
\boxed{8000} \text{ cubic inches}
\]
