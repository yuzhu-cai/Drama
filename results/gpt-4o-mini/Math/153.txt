To find the one hundredth positive integer that can be written using only the digits 0 and 1 in base 3, we first need to understand how numbers are represented in base 3 using only the digits 0 and 1.

In base 3, the digits 0 and 1 can be used to represent numbers in a binary-like fashion. Each number can be thought of as a binary number where each digit corresponds to a power of 3 instead of a power of 2.

For example, the base 3 representation of the number \( 110_3 \) can be calculated as follows:

\[
110_3 = 1 \cdot 3^2 + 1 \cdot 3^1 + 0 \cdot 3^0 = 9 + 3 + 0 = 12_{10}
\]

To find the one hundredth positive integer that can be expressed in this way, we can list the numbers that can be formed using the digits 0 and 1 in base 3. The numbers will correspond to binary numbers, where each binary digit represents whether to include the corresponding power of 3.

The first few numbers that can be formed using the digits 0 and 1 in base 3 are:

- \( 1_3 = 1_{10} \)
- \( 10_3 = 3_{10} \)
- \( 11_3 = 4_{10} \)
- \( 100_3 = 9_{10} \)
- \( 101_3 = 10_{10} \)
- \( 110_3 = 12_{10} \)
- \( 111_3 = 13_{10} \)
- \( 1000_3 = 27_{10} \)
- \( 1001_3 = 28_{10} \)
- \( 1010_3 = 30_{10} \)
- \( 1011_3 = 31_{10} \)
- \( 1100_3 = 36_{10} \)
- \( 1101_3 = 37_{10} \)
- \( 1110_3 = 39_{10} \)
- \( 1111_3 = 40_{10} \)

Continuing this process, we can generate numbers up to the one hundredth such number.

To find the one hundredth number, we can note that the numbers correspond to binary counting from \( 1 \) to \( 100 \). The binary representation of \( 100 \) is \( 1100100_2 \).

Now we convert \( 1100100_2 \) to base 3:

1. The binary number \( 1100100_2 \) corresponds to the decimal number \( 100 \).
2. We interpret this binary number as a base 3 number, where each digit corresponds to a power of 3.

Calculating \( 1100100_2 \) in base 3:

\[
1100100_2 = 1 \cdot 3^6 + 1 \cdot 3^5 + 0 \cdot 3^4 + 0 \cdot 3^3 + 1 \cdot 3^2 + 0 \cdot 3^1 + 0 \cdot 3^0
\]

Calculating the powers of 3:

\[
= 1 \cdot 729 + 1 \cdot 243 + 0 \cdot 81 + 0 \cdot 27 + 1 \cdot 9 + 0 \cdot 3 + 0 \cdot 1
\]

Adding these values together:

\[
= 729 + 243 + 9 = 981
\]

Thus, the one hundredth positive integer that can be written using only the digits 0 and 1 in base 3 is:

\[
\boxed{981}
\]
