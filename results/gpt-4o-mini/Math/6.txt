To compute \( e^{\pi i} \), we can use Euler's formula, which states:

\[
e^{ix} = \cos(x) + i\sin(x)
\]

In this case, we set \( x = \pi \). Therefore, we have:

\[
e^{\pi i} = \cos(\pi) + i\sin(\pi)
\]

Next, we evaluate \( \cos(\pi) \) and \( \sin(\pi) \):

\[
\cos(\pi) = -1
\]
\[
\sin(\pi) = 0
\]

Substituting these values back into the equation gives:

\[
e^{\pi i} = -1 + i \cdot 0 = -1
\]

Thus, we conclude that:

\[
\boxed{-1}
\]
