To compute the expression \(\dfrac{2^{10}-2^8}{2^7-2^6}\), we start by simplifying both the numerator and the denominator.

**Step 1: Simplify the numerator**

The numerator is \(2^{10} - 2^8\). We can factor out the common term \(2^8\):

\[
2^{10} - 2^8 = 2^8(2^2 - 1) = 2^8(4 - 1) = 2^8 \cdot 3
\]

**Step 2: Simplify the denominator**

The denominator is \(2^7 - 2^6\). We can factor out the common term \(2^6\):

\[
2^7 - 2^6 = 2^6(2 - 1) = 2^6 \cdot 1 = 2^6
\]

**Step 3: Substitute back into the expression**

Now we substitute the simplified forms of the numerator and denominator back into the expression:

\[
\dfrac{2^{10}-2^8}{2^7-2^6} = \dfrac{2^8 \cdot 3}{2^6}
\]

**Step 4: Simplify the fraction**

We can simplify the fraction by canceling \(2^6\) in the numerator and denominator:

\[
\dfrac{2^8 \cdot 3}{2^6} = 2^{8-6} \cdot 3 = 2^2 \cdot 3 = 4 \cdot 3 = 12
\]

Thus, the final answer is:

\[
\boxed{12}
\]
