To solve the equation \( 4 \cdot 12 = 103 \) in base \( b \), we first need to convert each term from base \( b \) to base 10.

1. **Convert \( 4 \) from base \( b \) to base 10**:
   \[
   4_b = 4_{10}
   \]

2. **Convert \( 12 \) from base \( b \) to base 10**:
   \[
   12_b = 1 \cdot b^1 + 2 \cdot b^0 = b + 2
   \]

3. **Convert \( 103 \) from base \( b \) to base 10**:
   \[
   103_b = 1 \cdot b^2 + 0 \cdot b^1 + 3 \cdot b^0 = b^2 + 3
   \]

Now we can rewrite the equation \( 4 \cdot 12 = 103 \) in base 10:
\[
4 \cdot (b + 2) = b^2 + 3
\]

Expanding the left side:
\[
4b + 8 = b^2 + 3
\]

Next, we rearrange the equation to set it to zero:
\[
b^2 - 4b + 3 - 8 = 0
\]
\[
b^2 - 4b - 5 = 0
\]

Now we can factor the quadratic equation:
\[
(b - 5)(b + 1) = 0
\]

Setting each factor to zero gives:
\[
b - 5 = 0 \quad \Rightarrow \quad b = 5
\]
\[
b + 1 = 0 \quad \Rightarrow \quad b = -1
\]

Since we are looking for a positive base, we take \( b = 5 \).

Finally, we verify that \( b = 5 \) satisfies the original equation:
- Calculate \( 12_5 \):
  \[
  12_5 = 1 \cdot 5 + 2 = 5 + 2 = 7
  \]
- Calculate \( 4 \cdot 12_5 \):
  \[
  4 \cdot 7 = 28
  \]
- Calculate \( 103_5 \):
  \[
  103_5 = 1 \cdot 5^2 + 0 \cdot 5 + 3 = 25 + 0 + 3 = 28
  \]

Since both sides equal \( 28 \), the equation holds true.

Thus, the positive base \( b \) is 
\[
\boxed{5}.
\]
