To solve the equation 

\[
\frac{6r^2 - 19r - 7}{2r - 7} = 4r - 3,
\]

we start by eliminating the fraction. We do this by multiplying both sides by \(2r - 7\), assuming \(2r - 7 \neq 0\):

\[
6r^2 - 19r - 7 = (4r - 3)(2r - 7).
\]

Next, we expand the right-hand side:

\[
(4r - 3)(2r - 7) = 4r \cdot 2r - 4r \cdot 7 - 3 \cdot 2r + 3 \cdot 7 = 8r^2 - 28r - 6r + 21 = 8r^2 - 34r + 21.
\]

Now, we set the two sides of the equation equal to each other:

\[
6r^2 - 19r - 7 = 8r^2 - 34r + 21.
\]

Next, we rearrange the equation by moving all terms to one side:

\[
6r^2 - 19r - 7 - 8r^2 + 34r - 21 = 0.
\]

Combining like terms, we have:

\[
(6r^2 - 8r^2) + (-19r + 34r) + (-7 - 21) = 0,
\]
which simplifies to:

\[
-2r^2 + 15r - 28 = 0.
\]

To make calculations easier, we can multiply the entire equation by \(-1\):

\[
2r^2 - 15r + 28 = 0.
\]

Next, we apply the quadratic formula \(r = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\), where \(a = 2\), \(b = -15\), and \(c = 28\):

Calculating the discriminant:

\[
b^2 - 4ac = (-15)^2 - 4 \cdot 2 \cdot 28 = 225 - 224 = 1.
\]

Now substituting into the quadratic formula:

\[
r = \frac{-(-15) \pm \sqrt{1}}{2 \cdot 2} = \frac{15 \pm 1}{4}.
\]

This gives us two potential solutions:

\[
r = \frac{16}{4} = 4 \quad \text{and} \quad r = \frac{14}{4} = \frac{7}{2}.
\]

Now we have \(r = 4\) and \(r = \frac{7}{2}\). We need to check if either of these values makes the denominator \(2r - 7\) equal to zero:

1. For \(r = 4\):
   \[
   2(4) - 7 = 8 - 7 = 1 \quad (\text{not zero}).
   \]

2. For \(r = \frac{7}{2}\):
   \[
   2\left(\frac{7}{2}\right) - 7 = 7 - 7 = 0 \quad (\text{zero}).
   \]

Thus, \(r = \frac{7}{2}\) is not a valid solution. Therefore, the only valid solution is:

\[
\boxed{4}.
\]
