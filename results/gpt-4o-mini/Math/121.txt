To find the first term in the sequence that is greater than 125, we will follow the pattern of the sequence step by step.

The sequence starts with:
- \( a_0 = 0 \)

Now we will calculate the subsequent terms using the alternating operations of addition and multiplication with successive integers.

1. **First term**: 
   \[
   a_1 = a_0 + 1 = 0 + 1 = 1
   \]

2. **Second term**: 
   \[
   a_2 = a_1 \times 1 = 1 \times 1 = 1
   \]

3. **Third term**: 
   \[
   a_3 = a_2 + 2 = 1 + 2 = 3
   \]

4. **Fourth term**: 
   \[
   a_4 = a_3 \times 2 = 3 \times 2 = 6
   \]

5. **Fifth term**: 
   \[
   a_5 = a_4 + 3 = 6 + 3 = 9
   \]

6. **Sixth term**: 
   \[
   a_6 = a_5 \times 3 = 9 \times 3 = 27
   \]

7. **Seventh term**: 
   \[
   a_7 = a_6 + 4 = 27 + 4 = 31
   \]

8. **Eighth term**: 
   \[
   a_8 = a_7 \times 4 = 31 \times 4 = 124
   \]

9. **Ninth term**: 
   \[
   a_9 = a_8 + 5 = 124 + 5 = 129
   \]

Now we have the sequence up to the ninth term:
- \( a_0 = 0 \)
- \( a_1 = 1 \)
- \( a_2 = 1 \)
- \( a_3 = 3 \)
- \( a_4 = 6 \)
- \( a_5 = 9 \)
- \( a_6 = 27 \)
- \( a_7 = 31 \)
- \( a_8 = 124 \)
- \( a_9 = 129 \)

The first term that is greater than 125 is \( a_9 = 129 \).

Thus, the answer is:
\[
\boxed{129}
\]
