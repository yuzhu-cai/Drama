To simplify the expression \( 19x + 1 - 4x - 81 \), we start by combining like terms.

First, we combine the \( x \) terms:
\[
19x - 4x = 15x.
\]

Next, we combine the constant terms:
\[
1 - 81 = -80.
\]

Now, we can rewrite the expression by putting together the simplified \( x \) term and the constant:
\[
15x - 80.
\]

Thus, the simplified expression is:
\[
\boxed{15x - 80}.
\]
