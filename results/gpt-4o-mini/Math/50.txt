To determine how long the housefly has been on the fan while traveling \( 19,404\pi \) feet, we first need to calculate the circumference of the circular path that the housefly follows.

The diameter of the fan is given as 6 feet. Therefore, the radius \( r \) is:

\[
r = \frac{6}{2} = 3 \text{ feet}
\]

The circumference \( C \) of the circle is calculated using the formula:

\[
C = 2\pi r
\]

Substituting the radius into the formula gives:

\[
C = 2\pi \times 3 = 6\pi \text{ feet}
\]

Next, we need to find out how many complete revolutions the housefly makes while traveling \( 19,404\pi \) feet. We can find the number of revolutions \( N \) by dividing the total distance traveled by the circumference:

\[
N = \frac{\text{Total Distance}}{\text{Circumference}} = \frac{19,404\pi}{6\pi}
\]

The \( \pi \) terms cancel out:

\[
N = \frac{19,404}{6} = 3,234
\]

Now, we know that the fan rotates at a rate of 20 revolutions per minute. To find the time \( t \) in minutes that the housefly has been on the fan, we can use the formula:

\[
t = \frac{N}{\text{Revolutions per minute}} = \frac{3,234}{20}
\]

Calculating this gives:

\[
t = 161.7 \text{ minutes}
\]

Finally, rounding to the nearest whole number, we find:

\[
\boxed{162}
\] 

Thus, the housefly had been on the fan for approximately 162 minutes.
