To solve the equation 

\[
\frac{\sqrt[3]{2x-4}}{\sqrt[3]{x+4}} = 2,
\]

we start by cross-multiplying to eliminate the fraction:

\[
\sqrt[3]{2x-4} = 2 \sqrt[3]{x+4}.
\]

Next, we can cube both sides to remove the cube roots:

\[
(\sqrt[3]{2x-4})^3 = (2 \sqrt[3]{x+4})^3.
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
2x - 4 = 8(x + 4).
\]

Now, we expand the right-hand side:

\[
2x - 4 = 8x + 32.
\]

Next, we will move all terms involving \(x\) to one side and constant terms to the other side. Subtract \(8x\) from both sides:

\[
2x - 8x - 4 = 32,
\]

which simplifies to:

\[
-6x - 4 = 32.
\]

Now, add 4 to both sides:

\[
-6x = 36.
\]

Finally, divide both sides by -6:

\[
x = -6.
\]

To ensure our solution is correct, we will substitute \(x = -6\) back into the original equation:

Calculating \(2x - 4\) and \(x + 4\):

\[
2(-6) - 4 = -12 - 4 = -16,
\]
\[
-6 + 4 = -2.
\]

Now substituting these values into the original equation:

\[
\frac{\sqrt[3]{-16}}{\sqrt[3]{-2}}.
\]

Calculating the cube roots:

\[
\sqrt[3]{-16} = -2 \quad \text{and} \quad \sqrt[3]{-2} = -1.
\]

Thus, we have:

\[
\frac{-2}{-1} = 2.
\]

Since both sides of the equation are equal, our solution is confirmed. Therefore, the value of \(x\) is 

\[
\boxed{-6}.
\]
