We start with the two equations given in the problem:

1. \( x + y = 153 \)
2. \( \frac{x}{y} = 0.7 \)

From the second equation, we can express \( x \) in terms of \( y \):

\[
x = 0.7y
\]

Next, we substitute this expression for \( x \) into the first equation:

\[
0.7y + y = 153
\]

Combining the terms on the left side gives:

\[
1.7y = 153
\]

Now, we solve for \( y \):

\[
y = \frac{153}{1.7}
\]

To simplify \( \frac{153}{1.7} \), we can multiply the numerator and denominator by 10:

\[
y = \frac{1530}{17}
\]

Now, we perform the division:

\[
1530 \div 17 = 90
\]

Thus, we find:

\[
y = 90
\]

Next, we substitute \( y \) back into the equation for \( x \):

\[
x = 0.7y = 0.7 \times 90 = 63
\]

Now we have both \( x \) and \( y \):

\[
x = 63, \quad y = 90
\]

We need to find the value of \( y - x \):

\[
y - x = 90 - 63 = 27
\]

Thus, the final answer is:

\[
\boxed{27}
\]
