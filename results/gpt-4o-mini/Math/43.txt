To convert the gestation period of the Asian elephant from days to weeks, you can divide the number of days by the number of days in a week (7 days).

So, for a gestation period of 609 days:

\[
\text{Weeks} = \frac{609 \text{ days}}{7 \text{ days/week}} \approx 87 \text{ weeks}
\]

Therefore, the average gestation period of the Asian elephant is approximately 87 weeks.
