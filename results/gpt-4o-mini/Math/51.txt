To solve the problem, we first need to determine the total number of parts in the ratio \(2:3:3:4\).

We can calculate the total number of parts as follows:

\[
2 + 3 + 3 + 4 = 12
\]

Next, we will find out how many apples correspond to each part. Since they have a total of 36 apples, we divide the total number of apples by the total number of parts:

\[
\text{Apples per part} = \frac{36}{12} = 3
\]

Now, we can calculate the number of apples each person receives based on the ratio:

- Amy receives \(2\) parts:
  \[
  2 \times 3 = 6 \text{ apples}
  \]

- Betty receives \(3\) parts:
  \[
  3 \times 3 = 9 \text{ apples}
  \]

- Cathy receives \(3\) parts:
  \[
  3 \times 3 = 9 \text{ apples}
  \]

- Daisy receives \(4\) parts:
  \[
  4 \times 3 = 12 \text{ apples}
  \]

Now, we need to find out how many apples Betty and Cathy have together. We add the number of apples they each receive:

\[
\text{Betty's apples} + \text{Cathy's apples} = 9 + 9 = 18
\]

Thus, the total number of apples that Betty and Cathy have together is 

\[
\boxed{18}
\]
