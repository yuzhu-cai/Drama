To find the sum of the quotient and remainder when dividing the polynomial \( 6x^3 + 9x^2 - 17x + 11 \) by \( 2x^2 + 5x - 1 \), we will perform polynomial long division.

1. **Set up the division**: We are dividing \( 6x^3 + 9x^2 - 17x + 11 \) by \( 2x^2 + 5x - 1 \).

2. **First division step**: 
   - Divide the leading term of the dividend \( 6x^3 \) by the leading term of the divisor \( 2x^2 \):
     \[
     \frac{6x^3}{2x^2} = 3x
     \]
   - Multiply the entire divisor \( 2x^2 + 5x - 1 \) by \( 3x \):
     \[
     3x(2x^2 + 5x - 1) = 6x^3 + 15x^2 - 3x
     \]
   - Subtract this from the original polynomial:
     \[
     (6x^3 + 9x^2 - 17x + 11) - (6x^3 + 15x^2 - 3x) = (9x^2 - 15x^2) + (-17x + 3x) + 11 = -6x^2 - 14x + 11
     \]

3. **Second division step**:
   - Now divide the leading term \( -6x^2 \) by \( 2x^2 \):
     \[
     \frac{-6x^2}{2x^2} = -3
     \]
   - Multiply the entire divisor \( 2x^2 + 5x - 1 \) by \( -3 \):
     \[
     -3(2x^2 + 5x - 1) = -6x^2 - 15x + 3
     \]
   - Subtract this from the current polynomial:
     \[
     (-6x^2 - 14x + 11) - (-6x^2 - 15x + 3) = (-14x + 15x) + (11 - 3) = x + 8
     \]

4. **Conclusion of division**:
   - The quotient is \( 3x - 3 \) and the remainder is \( x + 8 \).

5. **Sum of the quotient and remainder**:
   - We need to find \( (3x - 3) + (x + 8) \):
     \[
     3x - 3 + x + 8 = 4x + 5
     \]

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{4x + 5}
\]
