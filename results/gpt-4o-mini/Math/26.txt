To determine the greatest digit that can be placed in the circle (denoted as \( \bigcirc \)) so that the six-digit number \( 3\:5\:2\:9 \bigcirc 2 \) is divisible by 4, we need to focus on the divisibility rule for 4. A number is divisible by 4 if the number formed by its last two digits is divisible by 4.

In our case, the last two digits of the number are \( \bigcirc 2 \). We will denote the digit in the circle as \( x \), so the last two digits can be expressed as \( x2 \).

Next, we will check the values of \( x \) from 0 to 9 to find the largest digit that makes \( x2 \) divisible by 4.

We can evaluate each possibility:

- If \( x = 0 \), then \( 02 \) (which is 2) is not divisible by 4.
- If \( x = 1 \), then \( 12 \) is divisible by 4 (since \( 12 \div 4 = 3 \)).
- If \( x = 2 \), then \( 22 \) is not divisible by 4.
- If \( x = 3 \), then \( 32 \) is divisible by 4 (since \( 32 \div 4 = 8 \)).
- If \( x = 4 \), then \( 42 \) is not divisible by 4.
- If \( x = 5 \), then \( 52 \) is divisible by 4 (since \( 52 \div 4 = 13 \)).
- If \( x = 6 \), then \( 62 \) is not divisible by 4.
- If \( x = 7 \), then \( 72 \) is divisible by 4 (since \( 72 \div 4 = 18 \)).
- If \( x = 8 \), then \( 82 \) is not divisible by 4.
- If \( x = 9 \), then \( 92 \) is divisible by 4 (since \( 92 \div 4 = 23 \)).

Now, we summarize the values of \( x \) that make \( x2 \) divisible by 4:
- \( x = 1 \) gives \( 12 \)
- \( x = 3 \) gives \( 32 \)
- \( x = 5 \) gives \( 52 \)
- \( x = 7 \) gives \( 72 \)
- \( x = 9 \) gives \( 92 \)

The greatest digit \( x \) that satisfies the condition is \( 9 \).

Thus, the greatest digit that can be placed in the circle so that the six-digit number \( 3\:5\:2\:9 \bigcirc 2 \) is divisible by 4 is 

\[
\boxed{9}
