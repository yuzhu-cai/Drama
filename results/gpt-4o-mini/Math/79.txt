To solve the recurrence relation defined by \( a_1 = 14 \) and 

\[
a_n = 24 - 5a_{n-1} \quad \text{for } n \geq 2,
\]

we start by rewriting the recurrence relation in a more standard form:

\[
a_n + 5a_{n-1} = 24.
\]

Next, we will find the homogeneous solution by solving the equation:

\[
a_n + 5a_{n-1} = 0.
\]

The characteristic equation for this is:

\[
r + 5 = 0 \implies r = -5.
\]

Thus, the general solution to the homogeneous part is:

\[
a_n^{(h)} = C(-5)^{n-1},
\]

where \( C \) is a constant.

Now, we need to find a particular solution \( a_n^{(p)} \) to the non-homogeneous equation. We can try a constant solution \( a_n^{(p)} = A \). Substituting this into the recurrence gives:

\[
A + 5A = 24 \implies 6A = 24 \implies A = 4.
\]

Thus, a particular solution is \( a_n^{(p)} = 4 \).

The general solution to the recurrence relation is then:

\[
a_n = a_n^{(h)} + a_n^{(p)} = C(-5)^{n-1} + 4.
\]

Next, we use the initial condition \( a_1 = 14 \) to find \( C \):

\[
a_1 = C(-5)^{1-1} + 4 = C + 4 = 14.
\]

Solving for \( C \):

\[
C + 4 = 14 \implies C = 10.
\]

Thus, the formula for \( a_n \) is:

\[
a_n = 10(-5)^{n-1} + 4.
\]

We can express this in the required form \( a_n = p \cdot q^n + r \). Here, we have:

- \( p = 10 \),
- \( q = -5 \),
- \( r = 4 \).

Now, we calculate \( p + q + r \):

\[
p + q + r = 10 + (-5) + 4 = 10 - 5 + 4 = 9.
\]

Thus, the final answer is:

\[
\boxed{9}.
\]
