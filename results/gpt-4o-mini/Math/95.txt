To solve for \( j \), \( k \), and \( l \) given the equations \( jk = 24 \), \( jl = 48 \), and \( kl = 18 \), we can start by expressing \( j \), \( k \), and \( l \) in terms of one variable.

From the first equation, we can express \( k \) in terms of \( j \):

\[
k = \frac{24}{j}
\]

From the second equation, we can express \( l \) in terms of \( j \):

\[
l = \frac{48}{j}
\]

Now, we substitute \( k \) and \( l \) into the third equation \( kl = 18 \):

\[
\left(\frac{24}{j}\right) \left(\frac{48}{j}\right) = 18
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
\frac{24 \cdot 48}{j^2} = 18
\]

Calculating \( 24 \cdot 48 \):

\[
24 \cdot 48 = 1152
\]

Thus, we have:

\[
\frac{1152}{j^2} = 18
\]

To eliminate the fraction, we multiply both sides by \( j^2 \):

\[
1152 = 18j^2
\]

Now, we solve for \( j^2 \):

\[
j^2 = \frac{1152}{18}
\]

Calculating \( \frac{1152}{18} \):

\[
1152 \div 18 = 64
\]

Thus, we find:

\[
j^2 = 64
\]

Taking the positive square root (since \( j \) is positive):

\[
j = 8
\]

Now, we can find \( k \) and \( l \) using the expressions we derived earlier:

\[
k = \frac{24}{j} = \frac{24}{8} = 3
\]

\[
l = \frac{48}{j} = \frac{48}{8} = 6
\]

Now we have \( j = 8 \), \( k = 3 \), and \( l = 6 \). We can find \( j + k + l \):

\[
j + k + l = 8 + 3 + 6 = 17
\]

Finally, we verify that these values satisfy the original equations:

1. \( jk = 8 \cdot 3 = 24 \) (correct)
2. \( jl = 8 \cdot 6 = 48 \) (correct)
3. \( kl = 3 \cdot 6 = 18 \) (correct)

Thus, the solution is confirmed. Therefore, the final answer is:

\[
\boxed{17}
\]
