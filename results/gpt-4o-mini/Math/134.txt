To find the distance between the vertex of the graph of the equation \( y = x^2 + 2x - 6 \) and the point \( (4, 5) \), we first need to determine the coordinates of the vertex of the parabola represented by the equation.

The vertex of a parabola given by the equation \( y = ax^2 + bx + c \) can be found using the formula for the x-coordinate of the vertex:

\[
x = -\frac{b}{2a}
\]

In our equation, \( a = 1 \) and \( b = 2 \). Plugging in these values, we get:

\[
x = -\frac{2}{2 \cdot 1} = -1
\]

Next, we substitute \( x = -1 \) back into the equation to find the y-coordinate of the vertex:

\[
y = (-1)^2 + 2(-1) - 6
\]
\[
y = 1 - 2 - 6 = -7
\]

Thus, the vertex of the parabola is at the point \( (-1, -7) \).

Now, we need to calculate the distance between the vertex \( (-1, -7) \) and the point \( (4, 5) \). The distance \( d \) between two points \( (x_1, y_1) \) and \( (x_2, y_2) \) is given by the formula:

\[
d = \sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2}
\]

Substituting \( (x_1, y_1) = (-1, -7) \) and \( (x_2, y_2) = (4, 5) \):

\[
d = \sqrt{(4 - (-1))^2 + (5 - (-7))^2}
\]
\[
= \sqrt{(4 + 1)^2 + (5 + 7)^2}
\]
\[
= \sqrt{(5)^2 + (12)^2}
\]
\[
= \sqrt{25 + 144}
\]
\[
= \sqrt{169}
\]
\[
= 13
\]

Thus, the distance between the vertex of the graph and the point \( (4, 5) \) is 

\[
\boxed{13}.
