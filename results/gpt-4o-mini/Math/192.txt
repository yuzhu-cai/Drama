To find the expected winnings from one flip of the unfair coin, we will calculate the expected value \( E \) based on the probabilities and outcomes of each possible result.

The outcomes and their associated probabilities and winnings are as follows:

- **Heads**: 
  - Probability: \( P(H) = \frac{3}{5} \)
  - Winnings: \( W(H) = 4 \) dollars

- **Tails**: 
  - Probability: \( P(T) = \frac{1}{5} \)
  - Winnings: \( W(T) = -1 \) dollar (since it's a loss)

- **Edge**: 
  - Probability: \( P(E) = \frac{1}{5} \)
  - Winnings: \( W(E) = -10 \) dollars (since it's a loss)

The expected value \( E \) can be calculated using the formula:

\[
E = P(H) \cdot W(H) + P(T) \cdot W(T) + P(E) \cdot W(E)
\]

Substituting the values we have:

\[
E = \left( \frac{3}{5} \cdot 4 \right) + \left( \frac{1}{5} \cdot (-1) \right) + \left( \frac{1}{5} \cdot (-10) \right)
\]

Calculating each term:

1. For heads:
   \[
   \frac{3}{5} \cdot 4 = \frac{12}{5} = 2.4
   \]

2. For tails:
   \[
   \frac{1}{5} \cdot (-1) = -\frac{1}{5} = -0.2
   \]

3. For edge:
   \[
   \frac{1}{5} \cdot (-10) = -\frac{10}{5} = -2
   \]

Now, we combine these results:

\[
E = 2.4 - 0.2 - 2
\]

Calculating this step-by-step:

\[
E = 2.4 - 0.2 = 2.2
\]
\[
E = 2.2 - 2 = 0.2
\]

Thus, the expected winnings from one flip of the coin is:

\[
\boxed{0.20} \text{ dollars}
\]
