To simplify the expression \(\dfrac{\sqrt{10}}{\sqrt[4]{10}}\), we start by rewriting the square root and the fourth root in terms of exponents:

\[
\sqrt{10} = 10^{1/2}
\]
\[
\sqrt[4]{10} = 10^{1/4}
\]

Now we can substitute these into the original expression:

\[
\dfrac{\sqrt{10}}{\sqrt[4]{10}} = \dfrac{10^{1/2}}{10^{1/4}}
\]

Using the property of exponents that states \(\dfrac{a^m}{a^n} = a^{m-n}\), we can simplify the expression:

\[
\dfrac{10^{1/2}}{10^{1/4}} = 10^{1/2 - 1/4}
\]

Next, we need to perform the subtraction in the exponent:

\[
1/2 - 1/4 = \frac{2}{4} - \frac{1}{4} = \frac{2 - 1}{4} = \frac{1}{4}
\]

Thus, we have:

\[
10^{1/2 - 1/4} = 10^{1/4}
\]

Therefore, the expression \(\dfrac{\sqrt{10}}{\sqrt[4]{10}}\) equals \(10^{1/4}\).

In conclusion, the expression \(\dfrac{\sqrt{10}}{\sqrt[4]{10}}\) equals \(10\) raised to the power of 

\[
\boxed{\frac{1}{4}}.
