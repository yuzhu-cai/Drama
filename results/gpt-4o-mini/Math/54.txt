To evaluate \( 1^{(2^{235423523})} \), we start by recalling a fundamental property of exponents: for any real number \( a \), if \( a = 1 \), then \( 1^x = 1 \) for any exponent \( x \).

In this case, we have:

\[
1^{(2^{235423523})}
\]

Here, the base \( a \) is \( 1 \) and the exponent \( x \) is \( 2^{235423523} \). According to the property mentioned, regardless of the value of the exponent, the expression simplifies to:

\[
1^{(2^{235423523})} = 1
\]

Thus, the final result is:

\[
\boxed{1}
\]
