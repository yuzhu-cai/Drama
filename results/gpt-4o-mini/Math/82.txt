To solve the equation 

\[
\sqrt{5 |x| + 8} = \sqrt{x^2 - 16},
\]

we start by squaring both sides to eliminate the square roots:

\[
5 |x| + 8 = x^2 - 16.
\]

Rearranging this gives:

\[
x^2 - 5 |x| - 24 = 0.
\]

Next, we consider two cases based on the definition of absolute value.

**Case 1: \(x \geq 0\)**

In this case, \(|x| = x\). The equation simplifies to:

\[
x^2 - 5x - 24 = 0.
\]

We can solve this quadratic equation using the quadratic formula:

\[
x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} = \frac{5 \pm \sqrt{(-5)^2 - 4 \cdot 1 \cdot (-24)}}{2 \cdot 1} = \frac{5 \pm \sqrt{25 + 96}}{2} = \frac{5 \pm \sqrt{121}}{2} = \frac{5 \pm 11}{2}.
\]

Calculating the two possible values:

1. \(x = \frac{16}{2} = 8\),
2. \(x = \frac{-6}{2} = -3\) (not valid in this case since \(x \geq 0\)).

Thus, from Case 1, we have the root \(x = 8\).

**Case 2: \(x < 0\)**

In this case, \(|x| = -x\). The equation becomes:

\[
x^2 + 5x - 24 = 0.
\]

Again, we apply the quadratic formula:

\[
x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} = \frac{-5 \pm \sqrt{5^2 - 4 \cdot 1 \cdot (-24)}}{2 \cdot 1} = \frac{-5 \pm \sqrt{25 + 96}}{2} = \frac{-5 \pm \sqrt{121}}{2} = \frac{-5 \pm 11}{2}.
\]

Calculating the two possible values:

1. \(x = \frac{6}{2} = 3\) (not valid in this case since \(x < 0\)),
2. \(x = \frac{-16}{2} = -8\).

Thus, from Case 2, we have the root \(x = -8\).

Now we have found the roots of the original equation: \(x = 8\) and \(x = -8\).

To find the product of all the roots, we compute:

\[
8 \times (-8) = -64.
\]

Finally, we confirm that both roots satisfy the original equation:

For \(x = 8\):

\[
\sqrt{5 \cdot 8 + 8} = \sqrt{40 + 8} = \sqrt{48} = 4\sqrt{3},
\]
\[
\sqrt{8^2 - 16} = \sqrt{64 - 16} = \sqrt{48} = 4\sqrt{3}.
\]

For \(x = -8\):

\[
\sqrt{5 \cdot 8 + 8} = \sqrt{40 + 8} = \sqrt{48} = 4\sqrt{3},
\]
\[
\sqrt{(-8)^2 - 16} = \sqrt{64 - 16} = \sqrt{48} = 4\sqrt{3}.
\]

Both roots satisfy the original equation.

Thus, the product of all the roots is 

\[
\boxed{-64}.
\]
