To find \( p + q \), we start with the function given:

\[
f(x) = \frac{-px - 3}{-qx + 3}.
\]

We know that the point \( (7, -22) \) lies on both the graph of \( y = f(x) \) and \( y = g(x) \). Since \( g(x) \) is the inverse of \( f(x) \), this means:

\[
f(7) = -22 \quad \text{and} \quad g(-22) = 7.
\]

First, we calculate \( f(7) \):

\[
f(7) = \frac{-p(7) - 3}{-q(7) + 3} = \frac{-7p - 3}{-7q + 3}.
\]

Setting this equal to \(-22\):

\[
\frac{-7p - 3}{-7q + 3} = -22.
\]

Cross-multiplying gives:

\[
-7p - 3 = 22(-7q + 3).
\]

Expanding the right side:

\[
-7p - 3 = -154q + 66.
\]

Rearranging this equation leads to:

\[
-7p + 154q = 69.
\]

Next, we need to find \( g(-22) \). Since \( g(x) \) is the inverse of \( f(x) \), we have:

\[
f(g(-22)) = -22.
\]

Thus, we need to find \( x \) such that \( f(x) = -22 \):

\[
\frac{-px - 3}{-qx + 3} = -22.
\]

Cross-multiplying gives:

\[
-px - 3 = -22(-qx + 3).
\]

Expanding the right side:

\[
-px - 3 = 22qx - 66.
\]

Rearranging this equation leads to:

\[
-px - 22qx = -66 + 3,
\]

which simplifies to:

\[
(-p - 22q)x = -63.
\]

Thus, we have:

\[
x = \frac{-63}{-p - 22q} = \frac{63}{p + 22q}.
\]

Since we know \( g(-22) = 7 \), we set:

\[
\frac{63}{p + 22q} = 7.
\]

Cross-multiplying gives:

\[
63 = 7(p + 22q).
\]

Dividing both sides by 7:

\[
9 = p + 22q.
\]

Now we have a system of two equations:

1. \(-7p + 154q = 69\)
2. \(p + 22q = 9\)

We can solve this system. From the second equation, we can express \( p \) in terms of \( q \):

\[
p = 9 - 22q.
\]

Substituting this into the first equation:

\[
-7(9 - 22q) + 154q = 69.
\]

Expanding gives:

\[
-63 + 154q + 154q = 69,
\]

which simplifies to:

\[
308q - 63 = 69.
\]

Adding 63 to both sides:

\[
308q = 132.
\]

Dividing by 308:

\[
q = \frac{132}{308} = \frac{33}{77} = \frac{3}{7}.
\]

Now substituting \( q \) back into the equation for \( p \):

\[
p = 9 - 22 \left(\frac{3}{7}\right) = 9 - \frac{66}{7} = \frac{63}{7} - \frac{66}{7} = -\frac{3}{7}.
\]

Finally, we find \( p + q \):

\[
p + q = -\frac{3}{7} + \frac{3}{7} = 0.
\]

Thus, the answer is:

\[
\boxed{0}.
\]
