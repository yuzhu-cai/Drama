Let the number be represented as \( n \). According to the problem, when \( n \) is divided by 5, the remainder is 3. This can be expressed mathematically as:

\[
n \equiv 3 \pmod{5}
\]

We want to find the remainder when \( 2n \) is divided by 5. To do this, we can multiply both sides of the congruence by 2:

\[
2n \equiv 2 \cdot 3 \pmod{5}
\]

Calculating the right side gives:

\[
2n \equiv 6 \pmod{5}
\]

Next, we need to find the remainder of 6 when divided by 5. Performing the division:

\[
6 \div 5 = 1 \quad \text{with a remainder of } 1
\]

Thus, we can express this as:

\[
6 \equiv 1 \pmod{5}
\]

Therefore, we have:

\[
2n \equiv 1 \pmod{5}
\]

This means that when \( 2n \) is divided by 5, the remainder is 1. 

Thus, the final answer is:

\[
\boxed{1}
\]
