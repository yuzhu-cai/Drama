To compute \( 81_9 - 72_9 \), we first convert both numbers from base 9 to base 10.

Starting with \( 81_9 \):
\[
81_9 = 8 \cdot 9^1 + 1 \cdot 9^0 = 8 \cdot 9 + 1 \cdot 1 = 72 + 1 = 73_{10}
\]

Next, we convert \( 72_9 \):
\[
72_9 = 7 \cdot 9^1 + 2 \cdot 9^0 = 7 \cdot 9 + 2 \cdot 1 = 63 + 2 = 65_{10}
\]

Now we can perform the subtraction in base 10:
\[
73_{10} - 65_{10} = 8_{10}
\]

Next, we need to convert \( 8_{10} \) back to base 9. Since \( 8 \) is less than \( 9 \), it can be directly represented in base 9 as:
\[
8_{10} = 8_9
\]

Thus, the result of \( 81_9 - 72_9 \) in base 9 is:
\[
\boxed{8_9}
\]
