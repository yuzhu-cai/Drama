We start with the equation given in the problem:

\[
4x = 3y
\]

From this equation, we can express \(y\) in terms of \(x\):

\[
y = \frac{4}{3}x
\]

Next, we need to find the value of the expression \(\frac{2x+y}{3x-2y}\). We will substitute \(y\) with \(\frac{4}{3}x\) in the expression.

First, we calculate \(2x + y\):

\[
2x + y = 2x + \frac{4}{3}x = 2x + \frac{4}{3}x = \frac{6}{3}x + \frac{4}{3}x = \frac{10}{3}x
\]

Next, we calculate \(3x - 2y\):

\[
3x - 2y = 3x - 2\left(\frac{4}{3}x\right) = 3x - \frac{8}{3}x = \frac{9}{3}x - \frac{8}{3}x = \frac{1}{3}x
\]

Now we substitute these results back into the expression:

\[
\frac{2x+y}{3x-2y} = \frac{\frac{10}{3}x}{\frac{1}{3}x}
\]

To simplify this fraction, we can multiply both the numerator and the denominator by \(3\):

\[
\frac{\frac{10}{3}x}{\frac{1}{3}x} = \frac{10x}{1x} = 10
\]

Thus, the value of \(\frac{2x+y}{3x-2y}\) is:

\[
\boxed{10}
\]
