To solve the equation \(\sqrt{19 + 3y} = 7\), we start by squaring both sides to eliminate the square root:

\[
(\sqrt{19 + 3y})^2 = 7^2
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
19 + 3y = 49
\]

Next, we isolate the term involving \(y\) by subtracting 19 from both sides:

\[
3y = 49 - 19
\]

Calculating the right side gives:

\[
3y = 30
\]

Now, we solve for \(y\) by dividing both sides by 3:

\[
y = \frac{30}{3}
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
y = 10
\]

To ensure our solution is correct, we can substitute \(y = 10\) back into the original equation:

\[
\sqrt{19 + 3(10)} = \sqrt{19 + 30} = \sqrt{49} = 7
\]

Since both sides of the equation are equal, our solution is confirmed. Therefore, the final answer is:

\[
\boxed{10}
\]
